    "abstract": "This paper proposes an analytical-cum-conceptual framework for understanding the nature of institutions as well as their changes. First, it proposes a new definition of institution based on the notion of common knowledge regarding self-sustaining features of social interactions with a hope to integrate various disciplinary approaches to institutions and their changes. Second, it specifies some generic mechanisms of institutional coherence and change – overlapping social embeddedness, Schumpeterian innovation in bundling games, and dynamic institutional complementarities – useful for understanding the dynamic interactions of economic, political, social, organizational, and cognitive factors.",

    "abstract": "Social norms, the informal rules that govern behavior in groups andsocieties, have been extensively studied in the social sciences.Anthropologists have described how social norms function in differentcultures (Geertz 1973), sociologists have focused on their socialfunctions and how they motivate people to act (Durkheim 1895 [1982],1950 [1957]; Parsons 1937; Parsons & Shils 1951; James Coleman1990; Hechter & Opp 2001), and economists have explored howadherence to norms influences market behavior (Akerlof 1976; Young1998a). More recently, also legal scholars have touted social norms asefficient alternatives to legal rules, as they may internalizenegative externalities and provide signaling mechanisms at little orno cost (Ellickson 1991; Posner 2000)., With a few exceptions, the social science literature conceives ofnorms as exogenous variables. Since norms are mainly seen asconstraining behavior, some of the key differences between moral,social, and legal norms—as well as differences between norms andconventions—have been blurred. Much attention has instead beenpaid to the conditions under which norms will be obeyed. Because ofthat, the issue of sanctions has been paramount in the socialscience literature. Moreover, since social norms are seen as centralto the production of social order or social coordination, research onnorms has been focused on the functions they perform. Yeteven if a norm may fulfill important social functions (such as welfaremaximization or the elimination of externalities), it cannot beexplained solely on the basis of the functions it performs. Thesimplistic functionalist perspective has been rejected on severalaccounts; in fact, even though a given norm can be conceived as ameans to achieve some goal, this is usually not the reason why itemerged in the first place (Elster 1989a, 1989b). Moreover, although aparticular norm may persist (as opposed to emerge) because of somepositive social function it fulfills, there are many others that areinefficient and even widely unpopular., Philosophers have taken a different approach to norms. In theliterature on norms and conventions, both social constructs are seenas the endogenous product of individuals’ interactions (Lewis1969; Ullmann-Margalit 1977; Vandershraaf 1995; Bicchieri 2006). Normsare represented as equilibria of games of strategy, and as such theyare supported by a cluster of self-fulfilling expectations. Beliefs,expectations, group knowledge and common knowledge have thus becomecentral concepts in the development of a philosophical view of socialnorms. Paying attention to the role played by expectations insupporting social norms has helped differentiate between social norms,conventions, and descriptive norms: an important distinction oftenoverlooked in the social science accounts, but crucial when we need todiagnose the nature of a pattern of behavior in order to intervene onit.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscientists investigate the mechanisms of spatial memory. Molecular biologists study the mechanisms of protein synthesis and the myriad mechanisms of gene regulation. Ecologists study nutrient cycling mechanisms and their devastating imbalances in estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay. In fact, much of biology and its history involves biologists constructing, evaluating, and revising their understanding of mechanisms. With In Search of Mechanisms, Carl F. Craver and Lindley Darden offer both a descriptive and an instructional account of how biologists discover mechanisms. Drawing on examples from across the life sciences and through the centuries, Craver and Darden compile an impressive toolbox of strategies that biologists have used and will use again to reveal the mechanisms that produce, underlie, or maintain the phenomena characteristic of living things. They discuss the questions that figure in the search for mechanisms, characterizing the experimental, observational, and conceptual considerations used to answer them, all the while providing examples from the history of biology to highlight the kinds of evidence and reasoning strategies employed to assess mechanisms. At a deeper level, Craver and Darden pose a systematic view of what biology is, of how biology makes progress, of how biological discoveries are and might be made, and of why knowledge of biological mechanisms is important for the future of the human species.",

    "abstract": "Social ontology is the study of the nature and properties of thesocial world. It is concerned with analyzing the various entities inthe world that arise from social interaction., A prominent topic in social ontology is the analysis of social groups.Do social groups exist at all? If so, what sorts of entities are they,and how are they created? Is a social group distinct from thecollection of people who are its members, and if so, how is itdifferent? What sorts of properties do social groups have? Can theyhave beliefs or intentions? Can they perform actions? And if so, whatdoes it take for a group to believe, intend, or act?, Other entities investigated in social ontology include money,corporations, institutions, property, social classes, races, genders,artifacts, artworks, language, and law. It is difficult to delineate aprecise scope for the field (see section 2.1). In general, though, the entities explored in social ontology largelyoverlap with those that social scientists work on. A good deal of thework in social ontology takes place within the social sciences (see sections 5.1–5.8)., Social ontology also addresses more basic questions about the natureof the social world. One set of questions pertains to theconstituents, or building blocks, of social things in general. Forinstance, some theories argue that social entities are built out ofthe psychological states of individual people, while others argue thatthey are built out of actions, and yet others that they are built outof practices. Still other theories deny that a distinction can even bemade between the social and the non-social., A different set of questions pertains to how social categories areconstructed or set up. Are social categories and kinds produced by ourattitudes? By our language? Are they produced by causal patterns? Andis there just one way social categories are set up, or are there manyvarieties of social construction?, The term ‘social ontology’ has only come into widecurrency in recent years, but the nature of the social has been atopic of inquiry since ancient Greece. As a whole, the field can beunderstood as a branch of metaphysics, the general inquiry into thenature of entities.",

This will allow me to articulate the differences between the different forms of OSR and to argue in favour of the ‘eliminativist’ version.

    "abstract": "Are social groups real in any sense that is independent of the thoughts, actions, and beliefs of the individuals making up the group? Using methods of philosophy to examine such longstanding sociological questions, Margaret Gilbert gives a general characterization of the core phenomena at issue in the domain of human social life. After developing detailed analyses of a number of central everyday concepts of social phenomena--including shared action, a social convention, a group's belief, and a group itself--she proposes that the core social phenomena among human beings are \"plural subject\" phenomena. In her analyses Gilbert discusses the work of such thinkers as Emile Durkheim, Georg Simmel, Max Weber, and David Lewis. \"Gilbert's book aims to ... exhibit some general and structural features of the conceptual scheme in terms of which we think about social groups, collective action, social convention, and shared belief.... [It] offers an important corrective to individualistic thinking in the social sciences....\"--Michael Root, Philosophical Review \"In this rich and rewarding work, Margaret Gilbert provides a novel and detailed account of our everyday concepts of social collectivity. In so doing she makes a seminal contribution to ... some vexed issues in the philosophy of social science.... [An] intellectually pioneering work.\"--John D. Greenwood, Social Epistemology",

Yet, recent theoretical and empirical developments have created the conditions for rendering coherent the areas of overlap of the various behavioral disciplines. The analytical tools deployed in this task incorporate core principles from several behavioral disciplines. The proposed framework recognizes evolutionary theory, covering both genetic and cultural evolution, as the integrating principle of behavioral science. Moreover, if decision theory and game theory are broadened to encompass other-regarding preferences, they become capable of modeling all aspects of decision making, including those normally considered “psychological,” “sociological,” or “anthropological.” The mind as a decision-making organ then becomes the organizing principle of psychology.",

    "abstract": "This book argues for a new image of nature and of science—one that understands both natural and social phenomena to be the product of mechanisms, and that suggests that much of the work of natural and social scientists involves discovering, describing, and explaining how these mechanisms work. The book explores the interplay between ontological questions about mechanisms as things in the world and methodological questions about how these mechanisms can be characterized. Ontologically, mechanisms are understood to be collections of entities whose organized activities and interactions give rise to phenomena. This minimal conception of mechanism is abstract enough to encompass most of the wide variety of things that scientists have called mechanisms. While mechanisms are particular things, localized in space and time, the models that scientists use to describe them must be abstract and idealized. The mechanistic approach provides new ways of thinking about traditional metaphysical questions—for instance, about the nature of objects, part-whole and cause-effect relations, properties and universals, natural kinds, and laws of nature. It also suggests novel approaches for thinking about methodological questions concerning scientific representation, causal inference, reduction, and scientific explanation. The New Mechanical Philosophy offers the promise of a better understanding of the sources of both the unity and diversity of science.",

    "abstract": "Ontological debates have always been prominent in the philosophy of social science. Philosophers have typically conceived of such debates as pre-scientific attempts to reform social scientific practice, rather than as post-scientific reflections on a firm body of scientific knowledge. Two celebrated contemporary research programs in social ontology – collective intentionality and evolutionary game theory – also follow this approach. In this paper I illustrate their central elements and criticize their weak empirical foundations. I finish by reviewing some work that combines empirical evidence with theoretical reflection, and suggest that it constitutes the way forward in the philosophy of social science.",

We argue that these two approaches can be unified within an encompassing theory based on the notion of correlated equilibrium. We show that in a correlated equilibrium each player follows a regulative rule of the form ‘if X then do Y’. We then criticize Searle's claim that constitutive rules of the form ‘X counts as Y in C’ are fundamental building blocks for institutions, showing that such rules can be derived from regulative rules by introducing new institutional terms. Institutional terms are introduced for economy of thought, but are not necessary for the creation of social reality.",

The evolutionary approach which Harms favours begins with the common observation that if our senses and reasoning were not reliable, then natural selection would have eliminated them long ago. The challenge for some time has been how to transform these informal musings about evolutionary epistemology into a rigorous theoretical discipline capable of complementing current scientific studies of the evolution of cognition with a philosophically defensible account of meaning and justification.",

In the second part of the paper we show that constitutive rules can be derived from regulative rules via the introduction of theoretical terms. We argue that the constitutive rules theory is reducible to the rules-in equilibrium theory, and that it accounts for the way in which we assign names to social institutions.",

After showing how mathematics can play either a representational or an explanatory role by considering two alternative explanations of a same biological pattern—“Bergmann’s rule”—I offer an example of an explanation where the bulk of the explanatory job is done by a mathematical theorem, and where mechanisms involved in the target systems are not explanatorily relevant. Then I account for the way mathematical properties may function in an explanatory way within an explanation by arguing that some mathematical propositions involving variables non directly referring to the target system features constitute constraints to which a whole class of systems should comply, provided they are describable by a mathematical object concerned by those propositions. According to such “constraint account”, those mathematical facts are directly entailing the explanandum (often a limit regime, a robustness property or a steady state), as a consequence of such constraints. I call those explanations “structural”, because here properties of mathematical structures are accounting for the explanandum; various kinds of mathematical structures (algebraic, graph-theoretical, etc.) thereby define various types of structural explanations.",

My main focus is on three distinct ways that the social sciences can be about structural relations—exemplified by claims about social structure, reduced form structures in causal modeling, and equilibrium explanations—and on the implication of structuralist ideas for thinking about issues concerning causal explanation and nonreductive pictures of the unity of the science.",

Our article contributes to the philosophical and methodological foundations of the cognitive social sciences by proposing a framework based on contemporary mechanistic approaches to the philosophy of science to analyze the epistemological, ontological and methodological aspects of research programs at the intersection of the social sciences and the cognitive sciences. We apply this framework to three case studies which address the phenomena of social coordination, transactive memory, and ethnicity. We also assess how successful these research programs have been in providing mechanistic explanations for these phenomena, and where more work remains to be done.",

Now he offers a profound understanding of how we create a social reality--a reality of money, property, governments, marriages, stock markets and cocktail parties. The paradox he addresses in Making the Social World is that these facts only exist because we think they exist and yet they have an objective existence. Continuing a line of investigation begun in his earlier book The Construction of Social Reality, Searle identifies the precise role of language in the creation of all \"institutional facts.\" His aim is to show how mind, language and civilization are natural products of the basic facts of the physical world described by physics, chemistry and biology. Searle explains how a single linguistic operation, repeated over and over, is used to create and maintain the elaborate structures of human social institutions. These institutions serve to create and distribute power relations that are pervasive and often invisible. These power relations motivate human actions in a way that provides the glue that holds human civilization together. Searle then applies the account to show how it relates to human rationality, the freedom of the will, the nature of political power and the existence of universal human rights. In the course of his explication, he asks whether robots can have institutions, why the threat of force so often lies behind institutions, and he denies that there can be such a thing as a \"state of nature\" for language-using human beings.",

    "abstract": "Humans have a striking ability to coordinate their actions with each other to achieve joint goals. The tight interpersonal coordination that characterizes joint actions is achieved through processes that help with preparing for joint action as well as processes that are active while joint actions are being performed. To prepare for joint action, partners form representations of each other’s actions and tasks and the relation between them. This enables them to predict each other’s upcoming actions, which, in turn, facilitates coordination. While performing joint actions, partners’ coordination is maintained by (a) monitoring whether individual and joint outcomes correspond to what was planned, (b) predicting partners’ action parameters on the basis of familiarity with their individual actions, (c) communicating task-relevant information unknown to partners in an action-based fashion, and (d) relying on coupling of predictions through dense perceptual-information flow between coactors. The next challenge for the field of joint action is to generate an integrated perspective that links coordination mechanisms to normative, evolutionary, and communicative frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Equilibrium explanations use an equilibrium to represent and explain a system’s dynamic behavior. They provide a system with the property of global stability: a system will converge towards and remain in equilibrium regardless of its initial conditions and dynamic process. Thus, equilibrium explanations are generally treated as non-causal explanations. There are two claims subsumed under that comprehensive thesis. The first claim is that equilibrium explanations do not identify any causes because a system with global stability resists manipulation. The second claim is that even if equilibrium explanations do identify causes by manipulation, those causes are embedded in a system’s deeper, underlying structural relationships, and those causes are irrelevant to explaining a system’s behavior. Only the system’s structural relationships are relevant. But equilibrium explanations are not monolithic. I compare dynamic systems with multiple, competing equilibria to systems with a globally stable equilibrium. Equilibrium explanations of the former use intervention on a system’s initial conditions and dynamic process to manipulate equilibria, which identifies causes. Furthermore, a system’s initial conditions and dynamic process are relevant to explaining why one equilibrium is selected instead of another. I then apply these lessons to systems with a globally stable equilibrium and discuss when their corresponding equilibrium explanations have a proper role in the parent sciences.",

    "abstract": "Philippe Huneman ha cuestionado recientemente los límites en la aplicación de los modelos mecanicistas de la explicación científica en base a la existencia de lo que denomina \"explicaciones estructurales\", en las que el fenómeno se explica en virtud de las propiedades matemáticas del sistema en que el fenómeno ocurre. Las explicaciones estructurales pueden darse en formas muy diversas: en virtud de la forma de pajarita (bowtie) de la estructura, de las propiedades topológicas del sistema, de los equilibrios alcanzados, etc. El papel que juegan las matemáticas en las explicaciones que apelan a la estructura de pajarita o a las propiedades topológicas del sistema ha sido recientemente examinado en varios trabajos. Sin embargo, el papel exacto que juegan las matemáticas en el caso de las explicaciones en términos de equilibrio aún no ha sido totalmente clarificado, y diferentes autores defienden interpretaciones contradictorias, algunas de las cuales las asemejarían más al modelo defendido por algunos filósofos mecanicistas que al modelo estructural de Huneman. En este trabajo, tratamos de cubrir ese déficit estudiando el papel que juegan las matemáticas en el modelo de equilibrio anidado (nested equilibrium) elaborado por Blaser y Kirchner para explicar la estabilidad de las asociaciones ontogenética y filogenéticamente persistentes entre humanos y microorganismos. De nuestro análisis se desprende que su modelo es explicativo porque i) se identifica una estructura matemática del sistema que viene dada por un conjunto de ecuaciones diferenciales que satisfacen una estrategia evolutivamente estable; ii) la estructura anidada del modelo hace que la estrategia evolutivamente estable sea robusta ante posibles perturbaciones; iii) esto es así porque las propiedades del sistema empírico son isomorfas a, pero no causalmente responsables de, las propiedades de la estrategia evolutivamente estable. La combinación de estas tres tesis hace que las explicaciones en términos de equilibrios se asemejen más al modelo estructural de explicación que al modelo mecanístico. Philippe Huneman has recently questioned the widespread application of mechanistic models of scientific explanation based on the existence of structural explanations, i.e. explanations that account for the phenomenon to be explained in virtue of the mathematical properties of the system where the phenomenon obtains, rather than in terms of the mechanisms that causally produce the phenomenon. Structural explanations are very diverse, including cases like explanations in terms of bowtie structures, in terms of the topological properties of the system, or in terms of equilibrium. The role of mathematics in bowtie structured systems and in topologically constrained systems has recently been examined in different papers. However, the specific role that mathematical properties play in equilibrium explanations requires further examination, as different authors defend different interpretations, some of them closer to the new-mechanistic approach than to the structural model advocated by Huneman. In this paper, we cover this gap by investigating the explanatory role that mathematics play in Blaser and Kirschner's nested equilibrium model of the stability of persistent long-term human-microbe associations. We argue that their model is explanatory because: i) it provides a mathematical structure in the form of a set of differential equations that together satisfy an ESS; ii) that the nested nature of the ESSs makes the explanation of host-microbe persistent associations robust to any perturbation; iii) that this is so because the properties of the ESS directly mirror the properties of the biological system in a non-causal way. The combination of these three theses make equilibrium explanations look more similar to structural explanations than to causal-mechanistic explanation.",

    "abstract": "When people perform simple actions, they often behave efficiently, minimizing the costs of movement for the expected benefit. The present study addressed the question of whether this efficiency scales up to dyads working together to achieve a shared goal: Do people act efficiently as a group (i.e., coefficiently), or do they minimize their own or their partner’s individual costs even if this increases the overall cost for the group? We devised a novel, touch-screen-based, sequential object-transfer task to measure how people choose between different paths to coordinate with a partner. Across multiple experiments, we found that participants did not simply minimize their own or their partner’s movement costs but made coefficient decisions about paths, which ensured that the aggregate costs of movement for the dyad were minimized. These results suggest that people are able and motivated to make coefficient, collectively rational decisions when acting together.",

    "abstract": "Social ontology, in its broadest sense, is the study of the nature of social reality, including collective intentions and agency. The starting point of Tuomela's account of collective intentionality is the distinction between thinking and acting as a private person (\"I-mode\") versus as a \"we-thinking\" group member (\"we-mode\"). The we-mode approach is based on social groups consisting of persons, which may range from simple task groups consisting of a few persons to corporations and even to political states. Tuomela extends the we-mode notion to cover groups controlled by external authority. Thus, for instance, cooperation and attitude formation are studied in cases where the participants are governed \"from above\" as in many corporations. The volume goes on to present a systematic philosophical theory related to the collectivism-versus-individualism debate in the social sciences. A weak version of collectivism (the \"we-mode\" approach) depends on group-based collective intentionality. We-mode collective intentionality is not individualistically reducible and is needed to complement individualistic accounts in social scientific theorizing. The we-mode approach is used in the book to account for collective intention and action, cooperation, group attitudes, and social practices and institutions, as well as group solidarity. Tuomela establishes the first complete theory of group reasons (in the sense of members' reasons for participation in group activities). The book argues in terms of game-theoretical group-reasoning that the kind of weak collectivism that the we-mode approach involves is both conceptually and rational-functionally different from what an individualistic approach (\"pro-group I-mode\" approach) entails.",

    "abstract": "In the nineteenth century, there was substantial and sophisticated interest in neuroscience on the part of social theorists, including Comte and Spencer, and later Simon Patten and Charles Ellwood. This body of thinking faced a dead end: it could do little more than identify highly general mechanisms, and could not provide accounts of such questions as `why was there no proletarian revolution?' Psychologically dubious explanations, relying on neo-Kantian views of the mind, replaced them. With the rise of neuroscience, however, some of the problems of concern to earlier thinkers, such as imitation, have revived because of the discovery of neuronal mechanisms, or through fMRI studies. The article reviews the history and discusses the implications of current work for the reconsideration of traditional social theory concepts. It is suggested that certain kinds of bridging work with neuroscience would enable us to answer many questions in social theory that empirical sociology has failed to answer.",

In this paper, we suggest a minimal architecture for joint action that focuses on representations, action monitoring and action prediction processes, as well as ways of simplifying coordination. The architecture spells out minimal requirements for an individual agent to engage in a joint action. We discuss existing evidence in support of the architecture as well as open questions that remain to be empirically addressed. In addition, we suggest possible interfaces between the minimal architecture and other approaches to joint action. The minimal architecture has implications for theorising about the emergence of joint action, for human–machine interaction, and for understanding how coordination can be facilitated by exploiting relations between multiple agents’ actions and between actions and the environment.",

    "abstract": "In Making Things Happen, James Woodward develops a new and ambitious comprehensive theory of causation and explanation that draws on literature from a variety of disciplines and which applies to a wide variety of claims in science and everyday life. His theory is a manipulationist account, proposing that causal and explanatory relationships are relationships that are potentially exploitable for purposes of manipulation and control. This account has its roots in the commonsense idea that causes are means for bringing about effects; but it also draws on a long tradition of work inexperimental design, econometrics, and statistics. Woodward shows how these ideas may be generalized to other areas of science from the social scientific and biomedical contexts for which they were originally designed. He also provides philosophical foundations for the manipulationist approach, drawing out its implications, comparing it withalternative approaches, and defending it from common criticisms. In doing so, he shows how the manipulationist account both illuminates important features of successful causal explanation in the natural and social sciences, and avoids the counterexamples and difficulties that infect alternativeapproaches, from the deductive-nomological model onwards. Making Things Happen will interest philosophers working in the philosophy of science, the philosophy of social science, and metaphysics, and as well as anyone interested in causation, explanation, and scientific methodology.",

    "abstract": "The social network analysis (SNA) studies the interactions among actors in a network formed through some relationship (friendship, cooperation, trade, among others). The SNA is constantly approached from a binary point of view, i.e., it is only observed if a link between two actors is present or not regardless of the strength of this link. It is known that different information can be obtained in weighted and unweighted networks and that the information extracted from weighted networks is more accurate and detailed. Another rarely discussed approach in the SNA is related to the individual attributes of the actors (nodes), because such analysis is usually focused on the topological structure of networks. Features of the nodes are not incorporated in the SNA what implies that there is some loss or misperception of information in those analyze. This paper aims at exploring more precisely the complexities of a social network, initially developing a method that inserts the individual attributes in the topological structure of the network and then analyzing the network in four different ways: unweighted, edge-weighted and two methods for using both edge-weights and nodes’ attributes. The international trade network was chosen in the application of this approach, where the nodes represent the countries, the links represent the cash flow in the trade transactions and countries’ GDP were chosen as nodes’ attributes. As a result, it is possible to observe which countries are most connected in the world economy and with higher cash flows, to point out the countries that are central to the intermediation of the wealth flow and those that are most benefited from being included in this network. We also made a principal component analysis to study which metrics are more influential in describing the data variability, which turn out to be mostly the weighted metrics which include the nodes’ attributes.",

It is entirely updated to the current situation of the disciplines covered, and expanded with particular regard to the new missions, that have become the main challenge for the armed forces in these first decades of the new millennium, with new insights to technological development toward so-called cyborg warriors, new forms of leadership and changes in soldier's identity and organisational culture. It is compiled of documents coming from various researchers at universities around the world as well as military officers devoted to the sector of study. Covered in this volume is a historical excursus of studies prior to contemporary research, interpretive models and theoretical approaches developed specifically for this topic, civic-military relations including issues surrounding democratic control of the armed forces, military culture, professional training, conditions and problems of minorities in the armed forces, an examination of the structural change within the military over the years including new duties and functions following the Cold War.",

In the Cold War era, Morris Janowitz was among the first to recognize that the military was a fruitful subject for social science to study. Asking who soldiers are, what they do, and what they believe, Janowitz’s studies of armed forces and society have guided the work of scholars and policy makers for three generations.\n\nThe Professional Soldier identifies three issues that confront civil-military relations to this day: how to judge the political consequences of military conduct, how to solve problems of international relations while using less force, and how to strengthen civilian control of the military while preserving professional military autonomy. A vital resource for students and anyone interested in understanding the past, present, and future of the armed services.",

If we cut it up it dies in the process: and so I conceive that the various branches of research that deal with this whole are properly distinguished by change in the point of sight rather than by any division in the thing that is seen. Accordingly, in a former book (Human Nature and Social Order), I tried to see society as it exists in the social nature of man and to display that in its main outlines. In this one the eye is focused on the enlargement and diversification of intercourse which I have called Social Organization, the individual, though visible, remaining slightly in the background. It will be seen from my title and all my treatment that I apprehend the subject on the mental rather than the material side. I by no means, however, overlook or wish to depreciate the latter, to which I am willing to ascribe all the importance that any one can require for it. Our task as students of society is a large one, and each of us, I suppose, may undertake any part of it to which he feels at all competent.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            Discovering community structure in complex networks is a mature field since a tremendous number of community detection methods have been introduced in the literature. Nevertheless, it is still very challenging for practitioners to determine which method would be suitable to get insights into the structural information of the networks they study. Many recent efforts have been devoted to investigating various quality scores of the community structure, but the problem of distinguishing between different types of communities is still open. In this paper, we propose a comparative, extensive, and empirical study to investigate what types of communities many state-of-the-art and well-known community detection methods are producing. Specifically, we provide comprehensive analyses on computation time, community size distribution, a comparative evaluation of methods according to their optimization schemes as well as a comparison of their partitioning strategy through validation metrics. We process our analyses on a very large corpus of hundreds of networks from five different network categories and propose ways to classify community detection methods, helping a potential user to navigate the complex landscape of community detection.",

    "abstract": "Community detection in networks is one of the most popular topics of modern network science. Communities, or clusters, are usually groups of vertices having higher probability of being connected to each other than to members of other groups, though other patterns are possible. Identifying communities is an ill-defined problem. There are no universal protocols on the fundamental ingredients, like the definition of community itself, nor on other crucial issues, like the validation of algorithms and the comparison of their performances. This has generated a number of confusions and misconceptions, which undermine the progress in the field. We offer a guided tour through the main aspects of the problem. We also point out strengths and weaknesses of popular methods, and give directions to their use.",

    "abstract": "A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known—a collaboration network and a food web—and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.",

    "abstract": "Most current survey papers classify community detection methods into broad categories and do not draw clear boundaries between the specific techniques employed by these methods. We survey in this paper all fine-grained community detection categories, the clustering methods that fall under these categories, and the techniques employed by these methods for optimizing each objective function. We provide methodology-based taxonomies that classify static and dynamic community detection methods into hierarchically nested, fine-grained, and specific classes. We classify the methods into the objective function they optimize. Each objective function class is classified into clustering categories. Each category is further classified into clustering methods. Methods are further classified into sub-methods and so on. Thus, the lowest subclass in a hierarchy is a fine-grained and specific method. For each method, we survey the different techniques in literature employed by the method. We empirically and experimentally compare and rank the different methods that fall under each clustering category. We also empirically and experimentally compare and rank the different categories that optimize a same objective function. In summary, the block-based, top-down divisive-based, random walk-based, and matrix eigenvector-based methods achieved good results. Finally, we provide fitness metrics for each objective function.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            Many community detection algorithms have been developed to uncover the mesoscopic properties of complex networks. However how good an algorithm is, in terms of accuracy and computing time, remains still open. Testing algorithms on real-world network has certain restrictions which made their insights potentially biased: the networks are usually small, and the underlying communities are not defined objectively. In this study, we employ the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark graph to test eight state-of-the-art algorithms. We quantify the accuracy using complementary measures and algorithms’ computing time. Based on simple network properties and the aforementioned results, we provide guidelines that help to choose the most adequate community detection algorithm for a given network. Moreover, these rules allow uncovering limitations in the use of specific algorithms given macroscopic network properties. Our contribution is threefold: firstly, we provide actual techniques to determine which is the most suited algorithm in most circumstances based on observable properties of the network under consideration. Secondly, we use the mixing parameter as an easily measurable indicator of finding the ranges of reliability of the different algorithms. Finally, we study the dependency with network size focusing on both the algorithm’s predicting power and the effective computing time.",

Detecting and clustering communities is a powerful step toward identifying the structural properties and the behavioral patterns in social networks. Recently, online learning has been progressively adopted by a lot of educational practices which raise many questions about assessing the learners' engagement, collaboration, and behaviors in the new emerging learning communities. This systematic literature review aims to assess the use of community detection techniques in analyzing the network's structure in online learning environments. It provides a comprehensive overview of the existing research that adopted those techniques with identifying the educational objectives behind their application as well as suggesting possible future research directions. Our analysis covered 65 studies that found in the literature and applied different community discovery techniques on various types of online learning environments to analyze their users' interactions patterns. Our review revealed the potential of this field in improving educational practices and decisions and in utilizing the massive amount of data generated from interacting with those environments. Finally, we highlighted the need to include automated community discovery techniques in online learning environments to facilitate and enhance their use as well as we stressed on the urge for further advance research to uncover a lot of hidden opportunities.\n            \n              This article is categorized under:\n              \n                \n                  Algorithmic Development > Statistics\n                \n                \n                  Algorithmic Development > Web Mining\n                \n                \n                  Application Areas > Education and Learning",

On the other hand, Bayesian methods for data analysis have not yet made much headway in cognitive science against the institutionalized inertia of 20th century null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Ironically, specific Bayesian models of cognition and perception may not long endure the ravages of empirical verification, but generic Bayesian methods for data analysis will eventually dominate. It is time that Bayesian data analysis became the norm for empirical methods in cognitive science. This article reviews a fatal flaw of NHST and introduces the reader to some benefits of Bayesian data analysis. The article presents illustrative examples of multiple comparisons in Bayesian analysis of variance and Bayesian approaches to statistical power.

    "abstract": "In dynamic topic modeling, the proportional contribution of a topic to a document depends on the temporal dynamics of that topic's overall prevalence in the corpus. We extend the Dynamic Topic Model of Blei and Lafferty (2006) by explicitly modeling document level topic proportions with covariates and dynamic structure that includes polynomial trends and periodicity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that utilizes Polya-Gamma data augmentation is developed for posterior inference. Conditional independencies in the model and sampling are made explicit, and our MCMC algorithm is parallelized where possible to allow for inference in large corpora. To address computational bottlenecks associated with Polya-Gamma sampling, we appeal to the Central Limit Theorem to develop a Gaussian approximation to the Polya-Gamma random variable. This approximation is fast and reliable for parameter values relevant in the text mining domain. Our model and inference algorithm are validated with multiple simulation examples, and we consider the application of modeling trends in PubMed abstracts. We demonstrate that sharing information across documents is critical for accurately estimating document-specific topic proportions. We also show that explicitly modeling polynomial and periodic behavior improves our ability to predict topic prevalence at future time points.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method that extends the persistence-based topological data analysis (TDA) that is typically used for characterizing shapes to general networks. We introduce the concept of the community tree, a tree structure established based on clique communities from the clique percolation method, to summarize the topological structures in a network from a persistence perspective. Furthermore, we develop efficient algorithms to construct and update community trees by maintaining a series of clique graphs in the form of spanning forests, in which each spanning tree is built on an underlying Euler Tour tree. With the information revealed by community trees and the corresponding persistence diagrams, our proposed approach is able to detect clique communities and keep track of the major structural changes during their evolution given a stability threshold. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in extracting useful structural insights for time-varying social networks.",

We formulate a nonparametric Bayesian model for community detection consistent with an intuitive definition of communities and present a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure for inferring the community structure. A Matlab toolbox with the proposed inference procedure is available for download. On synthetic and real networks, our model detects communities consistent with ground truth, and on real networks, it outperforms existing approaches in predicting missing links. This suggests that community structure is an important structural property of networks that should be explicitly modeled.",

    "abstract": "Spectral methods based on the eigenvectors of matrices are widely used in the analysis of network data, particularly for community detection and graph partitioning. Standard methods based on the adjacency matrix and related matrices, however, break down for very sparse networks, which includes many networks of practical interest. As a solution to this problem it has been recently proposed that we focus instead on the spectrum of the non-backtracking matrix, an alternative matrix representation of a network that shows better behavior in the sparse limit. Inspired by this suggestion, we here make use of a relaxation method to derive a spectral community detection algorithm that works well even in the sparse regime where other methods break down. Interestingly, however, the matrix at the heart of the method, it turns out, is not exactly the non-backtracking matrix, but a variant of it with a somewhat different definition. We study the behavior of this variant matrix for both artificial and real-world networks and find it to have desirable properties, especially in the common case of networks with broad degree distributions, for which it appears to have a better behaved spectrum and eigenvectors than the original non-backtracking matrix.",

In this work we present a novel approach to community detection that utilises the Bayesian non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) model to produce a probabilistic output for node memberships. The scheme has the advantage of computational efficiency, soft community membership and an intuitive foundation. We present the performance of the method against a variety of benchmark problems and compare and contrast it to several other algorithms for community detection. Our approach performs favourably compared to other methods at a fraction of the computational costs.",

New spectral methods based on non-backtracking random walks have recently been introduced that successfully detect communities in many sparse networks. However, the spectrum of non-backtracking random walks ignores hanging trees in networks that can contain information about their community structure. We introduce the reluctant backtracking operators that explicitly account for hanging trees as they admit a small probability of returning to the immediately previous node, unlike the non-backtracking operators that forbid an immediate return. We show that the reluctant backtracking operators can detect communities in certain sparse networks where the non-backtracking operators cannot, while performing comparably on benchmark stochastic block model networks and real world networks. We also show that the spectrum of the reluctant backtracking operator approximately optimises the standard modularity function. Interestingly, for this family of non- and reluctant-backtracking operators the main determinant of performance on real-world networks is whether or not they are normalised to conserve probability at each node.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY\n            We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree‐based models are briefly described.",

    "abstract": "Network inference has been extensively studied in several fields, such as systems biology and social sciences. Learning network topology and internal dynamics is essential to understand mechanisms of complex systems. In particular, sparse topologies and stable dynamics are fundamental features of many real-world continuous-time (CT) networks. Given that usually only a partial set of nodes are able to observe, in this paper, we consider linear CT systems to depict networks since they can model unmeasured nodes via transfer functions. Additionally, measurements tend to be noisy and with low and varying sampling frequencies. For this reason, we consider CT models since discrete-time approximations often require fine-grained measurements and uniform sampling steps. The developed method applies dynamical structure functions (DSFs) derived from linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to describe networks of measured nodes. A numerical sampling method, preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN), is used to refine coarse-grained trajectories to improve inference accuracy. The convergence property of the developed method is robust to the dimension of data sources. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the developed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods including group sparse Bayesian learning (GSBL), BINGO, kernel-based methods, dynGENIE3, GENIE3, and ARNI. The simulations include random and ring networks, and a synthetic biological network. These are challenging networks, suggesting that the developed method can be applied under a wide range of contexts, such as gene regulatory networks, social networks, and communication systems.",

The dependent variable is the changing (or evolving) relation network, represented by two or more observations of a directed graph with a fixed set of actors. The network evolution is modeled as the consequence of the actors making new choices, or withdrawing existing choices, on the basis of functions, with fixed and random components, that the actors try to maximize. Individual and dyadic exogenous variables can be used as covariates. The change in the network is modeled as the stochastic result of network effects (reciprocity, transitivity, etc.) and these covariates. The existing network structure is a dynamic constraint for the evolution of the structure itself. The models are continuous-time Markov chain models that can be implemented as simulation models. The model parameters are estimated from observed data. For estimating and testing these models, statistical procedures are proposed that are based on the method of moments. The statistical procedures are implemented using a stochastic approximation algorithm based on computer simulations of the network evolution process.",

The parameters of this model usually are estimated by a stochastic approximation version of the method of moments. Statistics that correspond to the parameters in a natural way are used for ﬁtting the model. Here we present an estimator based on the generalized method of moments, i.e., using more statistics than parameters, for minimizing the distance between observed statistics and their expected values. Again, the resulting equation is solved by stochastic approximation. Several algorithmic issues arise that have to be solved in order to obtain a stable procedure.

The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the\n              local\n              characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non‐degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large‐scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large‐scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is\n              not\n              directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly.",

    "abstract": "A class of statistical models is proposed that aims to recover latent settings structures in social networks. Settings may be regarded as clusters of vertices. The measurement model is based on two assumptions. (1) The observed network is generated by hierarchically nested latent transitive structures, expressed by ultrametrics, and (2) the expected tie strength decreases with ultrametric distance. The approach could be described as model-based clustering with an ultrametric space as the underlying metric to capture the dependence in the observations. Bayesian methods as well as maximum-likelihood methods are applied for statistical inference. Both approaches are implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.",

The distributions depend on a function which may be viewed as giving the potential energy of the configurations. Examples include models for interaction in a spatial region and on lattices and graphs. New models in the general class arise naturally, an example being a spatial model for points of different categories. Some general methods, including series expansions and a simulation method known from statistical mechanics, can be useful for many of these models. Several applications of this kind are considered, and some connections between the models and with the statistical mechanics are explored.",

    "abstract": "We argue that social networks can be modeled as the outcome of processes that occur in overlapping local regions of the network, termed local social neighborhoods. Each neighborhood is conceived as a possible site of interaction and corresponds to a subset of possible network ties. In this paper, we discuss hypotheses about the form of these neighborhoods, and we present two new and theoretically plausible ways in which neighborhood-based models for networks can be constructed. In the first, we introduce the notion of a setting structure, a directly hypothesized (or observed) set of exogenous constraints on possible neighborhood forms. In the second, we propose higher-order neighborhoods that are generated, in part, by the outcome of interactive network processes themselves. Applications of both approaches to model construction are presented, and the developments are considered within a general conceptual framework of locale for social networks. We show how assumptions about neighborhoods can be cast within a hierarchy of increasingly complex models; these models represent a progressively greater capacity for network processes to ?reach? across a network through long cycles or semipaths. We argue that this class of models holds new promise for the development of empirically plausible models for networks and network-based processes.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic actor-oriented (SAO) models are a family of models for network dynamics that enable researchers to test multiple, often competing explanations for network change and estimate the extent and relative power of various influences on network evolution. SAO models for the co-evolution of network ties and actor behavior, the most comprehensive category of SAO models, examine how networks and actor attributes—their behavior, performance, or attitudes—influence each other over time. While these models have been widely used in the social sciences, and particularly in educational settings, their use in organizational scholarship has been extremely limited. This paper provides a layperson introduction to SAO models for the co-evolution of networks and behavior and the types of research questions they can address. The models and their underpinnings are explained in nonmathematical terms, and theoretical explanations are supported by a concrete, detailed example that includes step-by-step model building and hypothesis testing, alongside an R script.",

    "abstract": "The stochastic actor oriented model (SAOM) is a method for modelling social interactions and social behaviour over time. It can be used to model network effects using both exogenous covariates and endogenous network configurations, but also the co-evolution of behaviour and social interactions. The estimation method mostly used is the Method of Moments (MoM). The model assumption that all individuals have the same evaluation function, however, is one of its limitations. The aim of this paper is to generalize the MoM estimation method for the SAOM to include random effects, so that the heterogeneity of individuals can be modelled more accurately. The linear evaluation function that models the probability of forming or removing a tie from the network, is decomposed in a fixed part, which is the current evaluation function of the SAOM, and a random part, with parameters that are individual-specific and random. The Robbins-Monro algorithm that is commonly used for MoM estimation in the SAOM, is extended to allow the estimation of the variance of the random parameters. We illustrate how for the model with random out-degree we can estimate the parameter of the random components, and how to test its significance. An application is made to Kapferer's Tailor shop dataset. It is shown that including a random out-degree constitutes a serious alternative to including various transitivity effects.",

    "abstract": "We propose a class of actor-oriented statistical models for closed social networks in general, and friendship networks in particular. The models are random utility models developed within a rational choice framework. Based on social psychological and sociological theories about friendship, mathematical functions capturing expected utility of individual actors with respect to friendship are constructed. Expected utility also contains a random (unexplained) component. We assume that, given their restrictions and contact opportunities, individuals evaluate their utility functions and behave such that they maximize the expected amount of utility. The behavior under consideration is the expression of like and dislike (choice of friends). Theoretical mechanisms that are modelled are, e.g., the principle of diminishing returns, the tendency towards reciprocated choices, and the preference for friendship relations with similar others. Constraints imposed on individuals are, e.g., the structure of the existing network, and the distribution of personal characteristics over the respondents. The models are illustrated by means of a data-set collected among university freshmen at 7 points in time during 1994 and 1995.",

    "abstract": "This study uses recent data to investigate if smoking initiation diffuses through friendship networks over the high school period and explores if diffusion processes differ across schools. One thousand four hundred and twenty-five racially and ethnically diverse youth from four high schools in Los Angeles were surveyed four times over the high school period from 2010 to 2013. Probit regression models and stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics tested for peer effects on smoking initiation. Friend smoking was found to predict adolescent smoking, and smoking initiation diffused through friendship networks in some but not all of the schools. School differences in smoking rates and the popularity of smokers may be linked to differences in the diffusion of smoking through peer networks. We conclude that there are differences in peer effects on smoking initiation across schools that will be important to account for in network-based smoking interventions.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. We examined the coevolution of adolescent friendships and peer influences with respect to their risk behaviors and social networking site use.\n            Methods. Investigators of the Social Network Study collected longitudinal data during fall 2010 and spring 2011 from 10th-grade students in 5 Southern California high schools (n = 1434). We used meta-analyses of stochastic actor-based models to estimate changes in friendship ties and risk behaviors and the effects of Facebook and MySpace use.\n            Results. Significant shifts in adolescent smoking and drinking occurred despite little change in overall prevalence rates. Students with higher levels of alcohol use were more likely to send and receive friendship nominations and become friends with other drinkers. They were also more likely to increase alcohol use if their friends drank more. Adolescents selected friends with similar Facebook and MySpace use habits. Exposure to friends’ risky online pictures increased smoking behaviors but had no significant effects on alcohol use.\n            Conclusions. Our findings support a greater focus on friendship selection mechanisms in school-based alcohol use interventions. Social media platforms may help identify at-risk adolescent groups and foster positive norms about risk behaviors.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n            The present study examined whether parenting and parental smoking can prevent children from selecting smoking friends during adolescence. 254 Adolescents of one Belgian secondary school participated. Self‐administered questionnaires were distributed among 2nd–4th graders (mean ages = 14.2–16.2 years) during spring 2006. Follow‐up was conducted 12 months later. Data was analyzed conducting longitudinal social network analyses. Results showed adolescents perceiving high parental psychological control had a significant higher tendency to select smoking friends. Perceived behavioral control and perceived parental support did not affect the selection of smoking friends. Furthermore, maternal smoking behavior affected the selection of smoking friends, although no effect of paternal smoking behavior on the selection of smoking friends was found. Adolescent smoking prevention efforts should focus on the influence of parents through their smoking behavior and their psychological control to decrease adolescents' tendency to select smoking friends resulting in fewer opportunities for negative peer influences to occur.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            Even in diverse schools that provide opportunities for interreligious friendships, Muslim youth disproportionally tend to be friends with Muslims rather than non-Muslims. Echoing broader debates about minorities’ self-segregation versus exclusion by majority group members, a key question is whether religious friendship segregation arises because of Muslims’ in-group bias or because of non-Muslims’ reluctance to befriend them. We suggest that the answer differs for Muslim boys and girls. Building on research on interreligious romantic relations and accounts of the lives of young Muslims and other ethno-religious minorities in Western societies, we propose that religious in-group bias is stronger for Muslim girls than for Muslim boys. Conversely, we expect non-Muslim youth to be more open to befriend Muslim girls than Muslim boys. Applying stochastic actor-oriented models of network dynamics to large-scale longitudinal data of friendship networks in German schools, we find that Muslim girls indeed have a strong in-group bias, whereas non-Muslim youth are not reluctant to be friends with them. Muslim boys, by contrast, have a much weaker in-group bias, but non-Muslim youth are less willing to be friends with them rather than with non-Muslims. A simulation analysis demonstrates that these gendered individual-level processes result in comparable aggregate patterns of friendship segregation among Muslim boys and girls. Religious friendship segregation thus arises because Muslim girls tend to self-segregate and non-Muslim youth are less willing to befriend Muslim boys although the latter are open to interreligious friendships. This gendered friendship-making behavior has implications for the larger question of minority social integration.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the collaboration structures and dynamics of the co-authorship network of all Slovenian researchers. Its goal is to identify the key factors driving collaboration and the main differences in collaboration behavior across scientific fields and disciplines. Two approaches to modelling network dynamics are combined in this paper: the small-world model and the mechanism of preferential attachment, also known as the process of cumulative advantage. Stochastic-actor-based modelling of co-authorship network dynamics uses data for the complete longitudinal co-authorship networks for the entire Slovenian scientific community from 1996 to 2010. We confirmed the presence of clustering in all fields and disciplines. Preferential attachment is far more complex than a single global mechanism. There were two clear distinctions regarding collaboration within scientific fields and disciplines. One was that some fields had an internal national saturation inhibiting further collaboration. The second concerned the differential impact of collaboration with scientists from abroad on domestic collaboration. In the natural, technical, medical, and biotechnical sciences, this promotes collaboration within the Slovenian scientific community while in the social sciences and humanities this inhibits internal collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Academic networks are expected to enhance scientific collaboration and thereby increase research outputs. However, little is known about whether and how the initial steps of getting to know other researchers translates into effective collaborations. In this paper, we investigate the evolution and co-evolution of an academic social network and a collaborative research network (using co-authorship as a proxy measure of the latter), and simultaneously examine the effect of individual researcher characteristics (e.g. gender, seniority or workplace) on their evolving relationships. We used longitudinal data from an international network in primary care cancer research: the CanTest Collaborative (CanTest). Surveys were distributed amongst CanTest researchers to map who knows who (the ‘academic social network’). Co-authorship relations were derived from Scopus (the ‘collaborative network’). Stochastic actor-oriented models were employed to investigate the evolution and co-evolution of both networks. Visualizing the development of the CanTest network revealed that researchers within CanTest get to know each other quickly and also start collaborating over time (evolution of the academic social network and collaborative network respectively). Results point to a stable and solid academic social network that is particularly encouraging towards more junior researchers; yet differing for male and female researchers (the effect of individual researcher characteristics). Moreover, although the academic social network and the research collaborations do not grow at the same pace, the benefit of creating academic social relationships to stimulate effective research collaboration is clearly demonstrated (co-evolution of both networks).",

    "abstract": "Changes in patterns of collaboration between Russian universities after the commencement of the Russian university excellence initiative (Project 5-100) are studied in this paper. While this project aimed to make leading Russian universities more globally competitive and improve their research productivity, it also happened to increase their cooperation. An analysis of affiliations and the co-authorship networks was conducted to explore scientific collaborations between and within the participating universities. Such analysis facilitates the investigation of the number of collaborations with other organizations, both domestic and international cooperation, and disciplinary differences. By analyzing the co-authorship networks, the position of universities in the academic network and the structure of collaborations among the participants were examined. A sample of 30 Russian universities, including participants in Project 5-100 and a control group of institutions with similar characteristics, was used. After joining the project, the participating universities increased both their cooperation with each other as well as with foreign universities and research institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences, especially in the high-quality segment. At the same time, the collaboration patterns of non-participating universities did not change significantly. The centrality of Project 5-100 universities in the global academic network has increased, along with their visibility and coupling in the national network. The historical division between university and academic sectors has diminished, while the participating universities have started to play a more important role in knowledge production within the country.",

Our framework draws on theory and research on information processing, social categorization, coordination, and homophily to posit the influence of cognitive, gender, and country diversity on innovation. Our longitudinal model is based on a unique data set of 1,354 researchers who helped create the new scientific field of oncofertility, by collaborating on 469 publications over a 4-year period. We capture the differences among researchers along cognitive, country, and gender dimensions, as well as examine how the resulting diversity or homophily influences the formation of collaborative innovation networks. We find that innovation, operationalized as publishing in a new scientific discipline, benefits from both homophily and diversity. Homophily in country of residence and working with prior collaborators help reduce uncertainty in the interactions associated with innovation, while diversity in knowledge enables the recombinant knowledge required for innovation.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation helps states realize mutual gains, but mistrust and disagreements over institutional design inhibit cooperation. This article develops a network explanation for how states achieve cooperation in the face of persistent coordination and collaboration problems. The analysis focuses on bilateral cooperation agreements, a vast body of treaties spanning multiple issue areas. Bilateral agreements constitute an evolving network of cooperative ties. This network defines the strategic environment in which states bargain over new agreements, endogenously influencing subsequent bilateral endeavors by revealing strategically valuable information about states’ trustworthiness and preferences over institutional design, while also generating externalities that incentivize bilateral partnerships. Inferential network analysis shows that states are more likely to create bilateral agreements if they (1) share agreements with common third parties, (2) accede to more agreements in general, and/or (3) share important exogenous characteristics with current bilateral partners. These network dynamics drive bilateral cooperation in everything from commodities to cultural exchange to fisheries.",

We find that different digital technologies may have varying impacts on freedom while affecting its diffusion via different political networks, and that related changes in civil liberties can be affected by both media freedom and internal political institutions. Our analysis suggests three key mechanisms linking information technology with democratic change and highlights the importance of a country's “susceptibility” to political influence that is triggered by greater digitally induced visibility.",

We describe inter-personal conflicts and assess theories of coalition formation in a small-scale human society. Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional social network analysis of men in two communities of Tsimane forager–horticulturalists, we find evidence of reciprocity in coalitional support, as well as evidence of transitivity: an ally of my ally is likely to become my ally. We find mixed support for coalition formation between individuals who share a common adversary. Coalition formation was also predicted by food- and labour-sharing and especially by kinship. Physically formidable men and men higher in informal status were more likely to provide coalitional support over time; evidence was mixed that they receive more coalitional support. The highest status men are hubs of a dense coalitional support network that indirectly link all men in the community. These findings suggest that male coalition formation is multiply motivated, and in general reveals the political dynamics that structure men's lives in small, relatively egalitarian communities.",

    "abstract": "Research on co-evolution of networks and behavior became possible with the emergence of student performance and behavior dynamic data collection and storage tools, as well as with the development of new social network analysis methods. Dynamic network analysis answers the question, how specific forms of student behavior, like bad habits, develop and propagate. It is also helpful in following how school or university students enter into friendship or antagonism with each other, as well as in assessing the impact social relations have on academic performance. The paper gives a review of the two key methods used for empirical analysis of social network dynamics. Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOM) represent one of the most elaborated techniques of social network dynamics investigation. This approach regards the present state of a network as dependable on its preceding state uniquely. Network evolution appears to be continuous, not discrete, so that a structural macro change is, in fact, a multitude of micro changes. Instead of dealing with structure of the network and prerequisites for its development, the SAOM model studies the processes underlying any changes recorded. Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (STERGM) are an alternative approach towards research on social network dynamics. In this case, the social network observed is a materialization of one of possible networks with predetermined characteristics. Any network develops in the result of a stochastic process, and the research should be aimed at discovering what forces this process is driven by. Comparison of an empirically discovered network with networks of similar size reveals structural features of the network and characteristics of actors who influenced the process of its establishment. In this paper, we also give an example of how both models can be used with the same set of data.",

    "abstract": "Human behavior depends on many factors including the social environment. Over the past decades, scholars have actively developed models that evaluate the impact of the environment on the individual. This article describes stochastic actor-oriented modeling (SAOM) which allows to test hypotheses about the structural evolution of social networks, as well as to analyze the co-evolution of networks and behavior in detail. The authors present theoretical and methodological foundations of SAOM; specify requirements for research design and data collection; consider the specification of the model and an example of co-evolution of the network and academic achievement of students; point out limitations of the method, and suggest promising avenues for further research. The article concludes that using SAOM is preferable for small social networks with low rotation, in particular, for organizational units and study groups. The authors argue that the existing studies mainly consider the educational context and social networks of young people that does not allow to draw conclusions about the evolution of social ties in communities of a different type and other age groups. In addition, most of the research is based on data collected in Western democracies which indicates the need to investigate a variety of samples.",

Based on the data from the Facebook group, which consists of 7 years of communication from 2011 till 2018, we constructed the networks based on commenting and reacting. The participants activity includes four main periods for stability evaluation of the community. The blockmodeling discloses the structural patterns of interactions in the community. The results show the \"core-periphery\" type of the global structure. The core and periphery are structured differently in the networks of comments and reactions. The stability between the positions in the global structure is high and while the structure may vary in some periods, the size of the core and periphery fluctuates. However, the stability within the positions of the global structure is low, according to the modified Rand index (Cugmas, Ferligoj, 2018).",

    "abstract": "Link prediction in online social networks is used to determine new interactions among its members which are likely to occur in the future. Link prediction in the coauthorship network has been regarded as one of the main targets in link prediction researches so far. Researchers have focused on analyzing and proposing solutions to give efficient recommendation for authors who can work together in a science project. In order to give precise prediction of links between two ubiquitous authors in a co-authorship network, it is preferable to design a similarity metric between them and then utilizing it to determine the most possible co-author(s). However, the relevant researches did not regard the integration of paper’s content in the metric itself. This is important when considering the collaboration between scientists since it is possible that authors having same research interests are more likely to have a joint paper than those in different researches. In this paper, we propose a new metric for link prediction in the coauthorship network based on the content similarity named as LDAcosin. Mathematical notions of the link prediction in the co-authorship network and a link prediction algorithm based on topic modeling are proposed. The new metric is experimentally validated on the public bibliographic collection.",

    "abstract": "Link prediction is an important and well-studiedproblem in network analysis, with a broad range of applicationsincluding recommender systems, anomaly detection, and denoising. The general principle in link prediction is to use thetopological characteristics of the nodes in the network to predictedges that might be added to or removed from the network. While early research utilized local network neighborhood tocharacterize the topological relationship between pairs of nodes, recent studies increasingly show that use of global networkinformation improves prediction performance. Meanwhile, in thecontext of disease gene prioritization and functional annotationin computational biology, \"global topological similarity\" basedmethods are shown to be effective and robust to noise andascertainment bias. These methods compute topological profilesthat represent the global view of the network from the perspectiveof each node and compare these topological profiles to assess thetopological similarity between nodes. Here, we show that, in thecontext of link prediction in large networks, the performance ofthese global-view based methods can be adversely affected byhigh dimensionality. Motivated by this observation, we proposetwo dimensionality reduction techniques that exploit the sparsityand modularity of networks that are encountered in practicalapplications. Our experimental results on predicting futurecollaborations based on a comprehensive co-authorship networkshows that dimensionality reduction renders global-view basedlink prediction highly effective, and the resulting algorithmssignificantly outperform state-of-the-art link prediction methods.",

    "abstract": "The data volume of various smart devices has exploded with the advent of the 5G communication era and the rapid development of Internet of Things technology. A large amount of data has higher requirements on the transmission protocol in the network. Most of the existing research focuses on studying a single node as the basic information transmission unit. However, social networks have complex topological structures, and such methods are difficult to grasp the evolutionary rules of the network. It usually leads to higher resource waste and problem complexity. A triad (a network subgraph containing three nodes) can not only provide accurate local topology information, but also its conversion rules are easy to describe, which can reduce the complexity of the problem. The mutual conversion between triads constitutes the evolution of the entire network. Based on this, this article first proposes a triad-based social network evolution analysis method (SNEA). SNEA includes a prediction algorithm (TPMPA) that learns the evolution of the triad transition probability matrix through time series and a quantization algorithm (TTHQA) that quantifies the impact of triad transformations on the network-based on random walks. SNEA integrates the advantages of the two algorithms to dynamically grasp the evolutionary rules of the network. Then this paper proposes a triad link prediction algorithm (TLPA) to quantitatively evaluate the results of the evolution analysis of the SNEA method. The TLPA algorithm reduces the blindness of message forwarding and unnecessary waste of resources by predicting the probability of a connection between nodes in the network. Experimental results show that compared with Epidemic, SECM, CRDNT, ICMT algorithms, our method has a prominent advantage in improving message delivery rate and reducing resource consumption.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes online user conversation topics and discourse on Twitter related to the “Liberate” Protest movement in reaction to social distancing guidelines at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interdisciplinary approaches in big data, machine learning, content analysis, and social network analysis (SNA) were used to characterize the communicative behavior, conversation themes, and network structures of Liberate protest supporters and non-supporters. Tweets were content coded and grouped within topic clusters produced from an unsupervised machine learning algorithm using natural language processing. An analysis of topic clusters found that tweets that support the protests are highly concentrated and have higher volumes of replicated tweets. Protest Supporters were also more likely to retweet other users while Non-Supporters were more likely to include a URL from an outside media source and produce a unique tweet. SNA was also used to assess the characteristics of retweet networks and found that the Protester Supporter network had a more centralized structure and was strongly influenced by a political organization, in contrast to the Non-Supporter network that had a larger number of smaller and more evenly-sized nodes and more driven by media personalities and commentators. Collectively, these characteristics indicate that protest supporters had more centralized, consistent and disseminated discourse protesting COVID-19 social distancing requirements compared to non-supporters who were more diverse in their criticism of the Liberate movement and generally more fragmented in their support of public health measures. Results from this study provide important insights into pandemic communication dynamics of opposing twitter communities, including in the context of those who oppose and support public health measures in a highly politicized social and online environment. Results are important in the context of assessing the messages, communication propagation and overall activities of social media communities in response to basic public health measures needed to contain this post-digital era global pandemic.",

One of the most commonly-used and successful recommendation algorithms is collaborative filtering, which explores the correlations within user-item interactions to infer user interests and preferences. However, the recommendation quality of collaborative filtering approaches is greatly limited by the data sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem we have previously proposed graph-based algorithms to explore transitive user-item associations. In this paper, we extend the idea of analyzing user-item interactions as graphs and employ link prediction approaches proposed in the recent network modeling literature for making collaborative filtering recommendations. We have adapted a wide range of linkage measures for making recommendations. Our preliminary experimental results based on a book recommendation dataset show that some of these measures achieved significantly better performance than standard collaborative filtering algorithms",

    "abstract": "Empirical data on real complex systems are becoming increasingly available. Parallel to this is the need for new methods of reconstructing (inferring) the structure of networks from time-resolved observations of their node-dynamics. The methods based on physical insights often rely on strong assumptions about the properties and dynamics of the scrutinized network. Here, we use the insights from machine learning to design a new method of network reconstruction that essentially makes no such assumptions. Speci cally, we interpret the available trajectories (data) as “features” and use two independent feature ranking approaches—Random Forest and RReliefF—to rank the importance of each node for predicting the value of each other node, which yields the reconstructed adjacency matrix. We show that our method is fairly robust to coupling strength, system size, trajectory length, and noise. We also nd that the reconstruction quality strongly depends on the dynamical regime.",

We formalize this question as the link‐prediction problem, and we develop approaches to link prediction based on measures for analyzing the “proximity” of nodes in a network. Experiments on large coauthorship networks suggest that information about future interactions can be extracted from network topology alone, and that fairly subtle measures for detecting node proximity can outperform more direct measures.",

    "abstract": "Complex networks are representations of real-world systems that can be better modeled as multiplex networks, where the same nodes develop multi-type connections. One of the important concerns about these networks is link prediction, which has many applications in social networks and recommender systems. In this article, similarity-based methods such as common neighbors (CNs) are the mainstream. However, in the CN method, the contribution of each CN in the likelihood of new connections is equally taken into account. In this work, we propose a new link prediction method namely Weighted Common Neighbors (WCN), which is based on CNs and various types of Centrality measures (including degree, k-core, closeness, betweenness, Eigenvector, and PageRank) to predict the formation of new links in multiplex networks. So, in this model, each CN has a different impact on the node connection likelihood. Moreover, we investigate the impact of interlayer information on improving the performance of link prediction in the target layer. Using Area under the ROC Curve and precision as evaluation metrics, we perform a comprehensive experimental evaluation of our proposed method on seven real multiplex networks. The results validate the improved performance of our proposed method compared with existing methods, and we show that the performance of proposed methods is significantly improved while using interlayer information in multiplex networks.",

    "abstract": "Evolving networks, which are composed of objects and relationships that change over time, are prevalent in many real-world domains and have become an significant research topic in recent years. Most of the previous link prediction studies neglect the evolution of the network over time and mainly focus on the predicting the future links based on a static features of nodes and links. However, real-world networks have complex dynamic structures and non-linear varying topological features, which means that both nodes and links of the networks may appear or disappear. These dynamicity of the networks make link prediction a more challenging task. To overcome these difficulties, link prediction in such networks must model nonlinear temporal evolution of the topological features and link occurrences information of the network structure simultaneously. In this article, we propose a novel link prediction method based on NARX Neural Network for evolving networks. Our model first calculates similarity scores based on quasi-local measures for each pair of nodes in different snapshots of the network and create time series for each pair. Then, NARX network is effectively applied to prediction of the future node similarity scores by using past node similarities and node connectivities. The proposed method is tested on DBLP coauthorship networks. It is shown that combining time information with node similarities and node connectivities improves the link prediction performance to a large extent.",

    "abstract": "An important task in network modeling is the prediction of relationships between classes of objects, such as friendship between persons, preferences of users for items, or the influence of genes on diseases. Factorizing approaches have proven effective in the modeling of these types of relations. If only a single binary relation is of interest, matrix factorization is typically applied. For ternary relations, tensor factorization has become popular. A typical application of tensor factorization concerns the temporal development of the relationships between objects. There are applications, where models with n-ary relations with n > 3 need to be considered, which is the topic of this paper. These models permit the inclusion of context information that is relevant for relation prediction. Unfortunately, the straightforward application of higher-order tensor models becomes problematic, due to the sparsity of the data and due to the complexity of the computations. In this paper, we discuss two different approaches that both simplify the higher-order tensors using coupled low-order factorization models. While the first approach, the context-aware recommendation tensor decomposition (CARTD), proposes an efficient optimization criterion and decomposition method, the second approach, the context-aware regularized singular value decomposition (CRSVD), introduces a generative probabilistic model and aims at reducing the dimensionality using independence assumptions in graphical models. In this article, we discuss both approaches and compare their ability to model contextual information. We test both models on a social network setting, where the task is to predict preferences based on existing preference patterns, based on the last item selected and based on attributes describing items and users. The experiments are performed using data from the GetGlue social network and the approach is evaluated on the ranking quality of predicted relations. The results indicate that the CARTD is superior in predicting overall rankings for relations, whereas the CRSVD is superior when one is only interested in predicting the top-ranked relations.",

    "abstract": "Link prediction has aroused extensive attention since it can both discover hidden connections and predict future links in the networks. Many unsupervised link prediction algorithms have been proposed to find these links in a variety of networks. However, there is an evaluation conundrum in unsupervised link prediction. Unobserved links heavily outnumber observed links in large networks, so it is unrealistic to quantify the existence likelihood of all unobserved links to evaluate these algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation paradigm that is sampling unobserved links to address this problem. First, we demonstrate that the proposed paradigm is feasible in theory. Then, we perform extensive evaluation experiments in real-world networks of different contexts and sizes. The results show that the performance of similarity-based link prediction algorithms is highly stable even at a low sampling ratio in large networks, and the evaluation time degradation caused by sampling is striking. Our findings have broad implications for link prediction.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic actor-oriented (SAO) models are a family of models for network dynamics that enable researchers to test multiple, often competing explanations for network change and estimate the extent and relative power of various influences on network evolution. SAO models for the co-evolution of network ties and actor behavior, the most comprehensive category of SAO models, examine how networks and actor attributes—their behavior, performance, or attitudes—influence each other over time. While these models have been widely used in the social sciences, and particularly in educational settings, their use in organizational scholarship has been extremely limited. This paper provides a layperson introduction to SAO models for the co-evolution of networks and behavior and the types of research questions they can address. The models and their underpinnings are explained in nonmathematical terms, and theoretical explanations are supported by a concrete, detailed example that includes step-by-step model building and hypothesis testing, alongside an R script.",

    "abstract": "The stochastic actor oriented model (SAOM) is a method for modelling social interactions and social behaviour over time. It can be used to model network effects using both exogenous covariates and endogenous network configurations, but also the co-evolution of behaviour and social interactions. The estimation method mostly used is the Method of Moments (MoM). The model assumption that all individuals have the same evaluation function, however, is one of its limitations. The aim of this paper is to generalize the MoM estimation method for the SAOM to include random effects, so that the heterogeneity of individuals can be modelled more accurately. The linear evaluation function that models the probability of forming or removing a tie from the network, is decomposed in a fixed part, which is the current evaluation function of the SAOM, and a random part, with parameters that are individual-specific and random. The Robbins-Monro algorithm that is commonly used for MoM estimation in the SAOM, is extended to allow the estimation of the variance of the random parameters. We illustrate how for the model with random out-degree we can estimate the parameter of the random components, and how to test its significance. An application is made to Kapferer's Tailor shop dataset. It is shown that including a random out-degree constitutes a serious alternative to including various transitivity effects.",

    "abstract": "We propose a class of actor-oriented statistical models for closed social networks in general, and friendship networks in particular. The models are random utility models developed within a rational choice framework. Based on social psychological and sociological theories about friendship, mathematical functions capturing expected utility of individual actors with respect to friendship are constructed. Expected utility also contains a random (unexplained) component. We assume that, given their restrictions and contact opportunities, individuals evaluate their utility functions and behave such that they maximize the expected amount of utility. The behavior under consideration is the expression of like and dislike (choice of friends). Theoretical mechanisms that are modelled are, e.g., the principle of diminishing returns, the tendency towards reciprocated choices, and the preference for friendship relations with similar others. Constraints imposed on individuals are, e.g., the structure of the existing network, and the distribution of personal characteristics over the respondents. The models are illustrated by means of a data-set collected among university freshmen at 7 points in time during 1994 and 1995.",

    "abstract": "This study uses recent data to investigate if smoking initiation diffuses through friendship networks over the high school period and explores if diffusion processes differ across schools. One thousand four hundred and twenty-five racially and ethnically diverse youth from four high schools in Los Angeles were surveyed four times over the high school period from 2010 to 2013. Probit regression models and stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics tested for peer effects on smoking initiation. Friend smoking was found to predict adolescent smoking, and smoking initiation diffused through friendship networks in some but not all of the schools. School differences in smoking rates and the popularity of smokers may be linked to differences in the diffusion of smoking through peer networks. We conclude that there are differences in peer effects on smoking initiation across schools that will be important to account for in network-based smoking interventions.",

Investigators of the Social Network Study collected longitudinal data during fall 2010 and spring 2011 from 10th-grade students in 5 Southern California high schools (n = 1434). We used meta-analyses of stochastic actor-based models to estimate changes in friendship ties and risk behaviors and the effects of Facebook and MySpace use.\n            Results. Significant shifts in adolescent smoking and drinking occurred despite little change in overall prevalence rates. Students with higher levels of alcohol use were more likely to send and receive friendship nominations and become friends with other drinkers. They were also more likely to increase alcohol use if their friends drank more. Adolescents selected friends with similar Facebook and MySpace use habits. Exposure to friends’ risky online pictures increased smoking behaviors but had no significant effects on alcohol use.\n            Conclusions. Our findings support a greater focus on friendship selection mechanisms in school-based alcohol use interventions. Social media platforms may help identify at-risk adolescent groups and foster positive norms about risk behaviors.",

The sample included 1419 Finnish secondary education students (690 males and 729 females, mean age 16 years at the outset) from nine schools. Participants identified three school friends and described their alcohol and tobacco use on two occasions one year apart. Actor‐based models simultaneously examined changes in peer network ties and changes in individual behaviors for all participants within each school. Multi‐level analyses examined changes in individual behaviors for adolescents entering new peer groups and adolescents in stable peer groups, both of which were embedded within the school‐based peer networks. Similar results emerged from both analytic methods:\n              Selection\n              and\n              socialization\n              contributed to similarity of alcohol use, but only\n              selection\n              was a factor in tobacco use.",

Self‐administered questionnaires were distributed among 2nd–4th graders (mean ages = 14.2–16.2 years) during spring 2006. Follow‐up was conducted 12 months later. Data was analyzed conducting longitudinal social network analyses. Results showed adolescents perceiving high parental psychological control had a significant higher tendency to select smoking friends. Perceived behavioral control and perceived parental support did not affect the selection of smoking friends. Furthermore, maternal smoking behavior affected the selection of smoking friends, although no effect of paternal smoking behavior on the selection of smoking friends was found. Adolescent smoking prevention efforts should focus on the influence of parents through their smoking behavior and their psychological control to decrease adolescents' tendency to select smoking friends resulting in fewer opportunities for negative peer influences to occur.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            Even in diverse schools that provide opportunities for interreligious friendships, Muslim youth disproportionally tend to be friends with Muslims rather than non-Muslims. Echoing broader debates about minorities’ self-segregation versus exclusion by majority group members, a key question is whether religious friendship segregation arises because of Muslims’ in-group bias or because of non-Muslims’ reluctance to befriend them. We suggest that the answer differs for Muslim boys and girls. Building on research on interreligious romantic relations and accounts of the lives of young Muslims and other ethno-religious minorities in Western societies, we propose that religious in-group bias is stronger for Muslim girls than for Muslim boys. Conversely, we expect non-Muslim youth to be more open to befriend Muslim girls than Muslim boys. Applying stochastic actor-oriented models of network dynamics to large-scale longitudinal data of friendship networks in German schools, we find that Muslim girls indeed have a strong in-group bias, whereas non-Muslim youth are not reluctant to be friends with them. Muslim boys, by contrast, have a much weaker in-group bias, but non-Muslim youth are less willing to be friends with them rather than with non-Muslims. A simulation analysis demonstrates that these gendered individual-level processes result in comparable aggregate patterns of friendship segregation among Muslim boys and girls. Religious friendship segregation thus arises because Muslim girls tend to self-segregate and non-Muslim youth are less willing to befriend Muslim boys although the latter are open to interreligious friendships. This gendered friendship-making behavior has implications for the larger question of minority social integration.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the collaboration structures and dynamics of the co-authorship network of all Slovenian researchers. Its goal is to identify the key factors driving collaboration and the main differences in collaboration behavior across scientific fields and disciplines. Two approaches to modelling network dynamics are combined in this paper: the small-world model and the mechanism of preferential attachment, also known as the process of cumulative advantage. Stochastic-actor-based modelling of co-authorship network dynamics uses data for the complete longitudinal co-authorship networks for the entire Slovenian scientific community from 1996 to 2010. We confirmed the presence of clustering in all fields and disciplines. Preferential attachment is far more complex than a single global mechanism. There were two clear distinctions regarding collaboration within scientific fields and disciplines. One was that some fields had an internal national saturation inhibiting further collaboration. The second concerned the differential impact of collaboration with scientists from abroad on domestic collaboration. In the natural, technical, medical, and biotechnical sciences, this promotes collaboration within the Slovenian scientific community while in the social sciences and humanities this inhibits internal collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Academic networks are expected to enhance scientific collaboration and thereby increase research outputs. However, little is known about whether and how the initial steps of getting to know other researchers translates into effective collaborations. In this paper, we investigate the evolution and co-evolution of an academic social network and a collaborative research network (using co-authorship as a proxy measure of the latter), and simultaneously examine the effect of individual researcher characteristics (e.g. gender, seniority or workplace) on their evolving relationships. We used longitudinal data from an international network in primary care cancer research: the CanTest Collaborative (CanTest). Surveys were distributed amongst CanTest researchers to map who knows who (the ‘academic social network’). Co-authorship relations were derived from Scopus (the ‘collaborative network’). Stochastic actor-oriented models were employed to investigate the evolution and co-evolution of both networks. Visualizing the development of the CanTest network revealed that researchers within CanTest get to know each other quickly and also start collaborating over time (evolution of the academic social network and collaborative network respectively). Results point to a stable and solid academic social network that is particularly encouraging towards more junior researchers; yet differing for male and female researchers (the effect of individual researcher characteristics). Moreover, although the academic social network and the research collaborations do not grow at the same pace, the benefit of creating academic social relationships to stimulate effective research collaboration is clearly demonstrated (co-evolution of both networks).",

    "abstract": "Changes in patterns of collaboration between Russian universities after the commencement of the Russian university excellence initiative (Project 5-100) are studied in this paper. While this project aimed to make leading Russian universities more globally competitive and improve their research productivity, it also happened to increase their cooperation. An analysis of affiliations and the co-authorship networks was conducted to explore scientific collaborations between and within the participating universities. Such analysis facilitates the investigation of the number of collaborations with other organizations, both domestic and international cooperation, and disciplinary differences. By analyzing the co-authorship networks, the position of universities in the academic network and the structure of collaborations among the participants were examined. A sample of 30 Russian universities, including participants in Project 5-100 and a control group of institutions with similar characteristics, was used. After joining the project, the participating universities increased both their cooperation with each other as well as with foreign universities and research institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences, especially in the high-quality segment. At the same time, the collaboration patterns of non-participating universities did not change significantly. The centrality of Project 5-100 universities in the global academic network has increased, along with their visibility and coupling in the national network. The historical division between university and academic sectors has diminished, while the participating universities have started to play a more important role in knowledge production within the country.",

Our framework draws on theory and research on information processing, social categorization, coordination, and homophily to posit the influence of cognitive, gender, and country diversity on innovation. Our longitudinal model is based on a unique data set of 1,354 researchers who helped create the new scientific field of oncofertility, by collaborating on 469 publications over a 4-year period. We capture the differences among researchers along cognitive, country, and gender dimensions, as well as examine how the resulting diversity or homophily influences the formation of collaborative innovation networks. We find that innovation, operationalized as publishing in a new scientific discipline, benefits from both homophily and diversity. Homophily in country of residence and working with prior collaborators help reduce uncertainty in the interactions associated with innovation, while diversity in knowledge enables the recombinant knowledge required for innovation.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation helps states realize mutual gains, but mistrust and disagreements over institutional design inhibit cooperation. This article develops a network explanation for how states achieve cooperation in the face of persistent coordination and collaboration problems. The analysis focuses on bilateral cooperation agreements, a vast body of treaties spanning multiple issue areas. Bilateral agreements constitute an evolving network of cooperative ties. This network defines the strategic environment in which states bargain over new agreements, endogenously influencing subsequent bilateral endeavors by revealing strategically valuable information about states’ trustworthiness and preferences over institutional design, while also generating externalities that incentivize bilateral partnerships. Inferential network analysis shows that states are more likely to create bilateral agreements if they (1) share agreements with common third parties, (2) accede to more agreements in general, and/or (3) share important exogenous characteristics with current bilateral partners. These network dynamics drive bilateral cooperation in everything from commodities to cultural exchange to fisheries.",

Our analysis suggests three key mechanisms linking information technology with democratic change and highlights the importance of a country's “susceptibility” to political influence that is triggered by greater digitally induced visibility.",

We describe inter-personal conflicts and assess theories of coalition formation in a small-scale human society. Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional social network analysis of men in two communities of Tsimane forager–horticulturalists, we find evidence of reciprocity in coalitional support, as well as evidence of transitivity: an ally of my ally is likely to become my ally. We find mixed support for coalition formation between individuals who share a common adversary. Coalition formation was also predicted by food- and labour-sharing and especially by kinship. Physically formidable men and men higher in informal status were more likely to provide coalitional support over time; evidence was mixed that they receive more coalitional support. The highest status men are hubs of a dense coalitional support network that indirectly link all men in the community. These findings suggest that male coalition formation is multiply motivated, and in general reveals the political dynamics that structure men's lives in small, relatively egalitarian communities.",

    "abstract": "Research on co-evolution of networks and behavior became possible with the emergence of student performance and behavior dynamic data collection and storage tools, as well as with the development of new social network analysis methods. Dynamic network analysis answers the question, how specific forms of student behavior, like bad habits, develop and propagate. It is also helpful in following how school or university students enter into friendship or antagonism with each other, as well as in assessing the impact social relations have on academic performance. The paper gives a review of the two key methods used for empirical analysis of social network dynamics. Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOM) represent one of the most elaborated techniques of social network dynamics investigation. This approach regards the present state of a network as dependable on its preceding state uniquely. Network evolution appears to be continuous, not discrete, so that a structural macro change is, in fact, a multitude of micro changes. Instead of dealing with structure of the network and prerequisites for its development, the SAOM model studies the processes underlying any changes recorded. Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (STERGM) are an alternative approach towards research on social network dynamics. In this case, the social network observed is a materialization of one of possible networks with predetermined characteristics. Any network develops in the result of a stochastic process, and the research should be aimed at discovering what forces this process is driven by. Comparison of an empirically discovered network with networks of similar size reveals structural features of the network and characteristics of actors who influenced the process of its establishment. In this paper, we also give an example of how both models can be used with the same set of data.",

    "abstract": "Human behavior depends on many factors including the social environment. Over the past decades, scholars have actively developed models that evaluate the impact of the environment on the individual. This article describes stochastic actor-oriented modeling (SAOM) which allows to test hypotheses about the structural evolution of social networks, as well as to analyze the co-evolution of networks and behavior in detail. The authors present theoretical and methodological foundations of SAOM; specify requirements for research design and data collection; consider the specification of the model and an example of co-evolution of the network and academic achievement of students; point out limitations of the method, and suggest promising avenues for further research. The article concludes that using SAOM is preferable for small social networks with low rotation, in particular, for organizational units and study groups. The authors argue that the existing studies mainly consider the educational context and social networks of young people that does not allow to draw conclusions about the evolution of social ties in communities of a different type and other age groups. In addition, most of the research is based on data collected in Western democracies which indicates the need to investigate a variety of samples.",

Based on the data from the Facebook group, which consists of 7 years of communication from 2011 till 2018, we constructed the networks based on commenting and reacting. The participants activity includes four main periods for stability evaluation of the community. The blockmodeling discloses the structural patterns of interactions in the community. The results show the \"core-periphery\" type of the global structure. The core and periphery are structured differently in the networks of comments and reactions. The stability between the positions in the global structure is high and while the structure may vary in some periods, the size of the core and periphery fluctuates. However, the stability within the positions of the global structure is low, according to the modified Rand index (Cugmas, Ferligoj, 2018).",

    "abstract": "Tensor decomposition is a powerful computational tool for multiway data analysis. Many popular tensor decomposition approaches—such as the Tucker decomposition and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)—amount to multi-linear factorization. They are insufficient to model (i) complex interactions between data entities, (ii) various data types (e.g., missing data and binary data), and (iii) noisy observations and outliers. To address these issues, we propose tensor-variate latent nonparametric Bayesian models for multiway data analysis. We name these models InfTucker. These new models essentially conduct Tucker decomposition in an infinite feature space. Unlike classical tensor decomposition models, our new approaches handle both continuous and binary data in a probabilistic framework. Unlike previous Bayesian models on matrices and tensors, our models are based on latent Gaussian or \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$t$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n processes with nonlinear covariance functions. Moreover, on network data, our models reduce to nonparametric stochastic blockmodels and can be used to discover latent groups and predict missing interactions. To learn the models efficiently from data, we develop a variational inference technique and explore properties of the Kronecker product for computational efficiency. Compared with a classical variational implementation, this technique reduces both time and space complexities by several orders of magnitude. On real multiway and network data, our new models achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy than state-of-art tensor decomposition methods and blockmodels.",

Analyzing such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple exchangeability assumptions underlying many boilerplate models no longer hold. In this paper, we describe a class of latent variable models of such data called Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels. This model extends blockmodels for relational data to ones which capture mixed membership latent relational structure, thus providing an object-specific low-dimensional representation. We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We explore applications to social networks and protein interaction networks.",

Such complex networks arise commonly in social sciences, biology, ecology, etc. We propose a flexible probabilistic model named Multipartite Block Model (MBM) able to unravel the topology of multipartite networks by identifying clusters (blocks) of nodes sharing the same patterns of connectivity across the collection of networks they are involved in. The model parameters are estimated through a variational version of the Expectation?Maximization algorithm. The numbers of blocks are chosen using an Integrated Completed Likelihood criterion specifically designed for our model. A simulation study illustrates the robustness of the inference strategy. Finally, two datasets respectively issued from ecology and ethnobiology are analyzed with the MBM in order to illustrate its flexibility and its relevance for the analysis of real datasets.The inference procedure is implemented in an R-package GREMLIN, available on Github (https://github.com/Demiperimetre/GREMLINhttps://github.com/Demiperimetre/GREMLIN).",

This model assumes a hidden Markov chain for the evolution of the social behavior of a group of individuals at repeated time occasions and may be used to assign these individuals to the latent blocks in a dynamic fashion. For the estimation of this model, the proposed exact algorithm maximizes the target function introduced by Matias and Miele [7]. This function is derived from a variational approximation of the model log-likelihood, based on the assumption that the latent variables identifying the blocks are a posteriori independent across individuals, but not across time occasions. A simulation study is performed to compare the exact algorithm with the approximate maximization algorithm proposed by Matias and Miele [7]. Results show that there is a certain advantage of the first in terms of dynamic assignment of individuals to the latent blocks in comparison to the true blocking structure, as measured by the adjusted Rand index.",

    "abstract": "The two-mode KL-means partitioning (TMKLMP) problem has a number of important applications in the social and physical sciences. For example, the intra-block variability measure associated with TMKLMP underscores its direct relevance to two-mode homogeneity blockmodeling of binary and real-valued social networks. We present a real-coded genetic algorithm for obtaining TMKLMP solutions. A simulation study showed that the new algorithm compares favorably to a multistart implementation of a two-mode KL-means heuristic, which is recognized as a top-performing method for TMKLMP. The merit of the proposed method is demonstrated via an application to the blockmodeling of social network data associated with signing of environmental advertisements in the New York Times as a part of the Turning Point Project.",

    "abstract": "Social behavior over short time scales is frequently understood in terms of actions, which can be thought of as discrete events in which one individual emits a behavior directed at one or more other entities in his or her environment (possibly including himself or herself). Here, we introduce a highly flexible framework for modeling actions within social settings, which permits likelihood-based inference for behavioral mechanisms with complex dependence. Examples are given for the parameterization of base activity levels, recency, persistence, preferential attachment, transitive/cyclic interaction, and participation shifts within the relational event framework. Parameter estimation is discussed both for data in which an exact history of events is available, and for data in which only event sequences are known. The utility of the framework is illustrated via an application to dynamic modeling of responder radio communications during the early hours of the World Trade Center disaster.",

    "abstract": "A multilevel network is defined as the junction of two interaction networks, one level representing the interactions between individuals and the other the interactions between organizations. The levels are linked by an affiliation relationship, each individual belonging to a unique organization. A new Stochastic Block Model is proposed as a unified probabilistic framework tailored for multilevel networks. This model contains latent blocks accounting for heterogeneity in the patterns of connection within each level and introducing dependencies between the levels. The sought connection patterns are not specified a priori which makes this approach flexible. Variational methods are used for the model inference and an Integrated Classified Likelihood criterion is developed for choosing the number of blocks and also for deciding whether the two levels are dependent or not. A comprehensive simulation study exhibits the benefit of considering this approach, illustrates the robustness of the clustering and highlights the reliability of the criterion used for model selection. This approach is applied on a sociological dataset collected during a television program trade fair, the inter-organizational level being the economic network between companies and the inter-individual level being the informal network between their representatives. It brings a synthetic representation of the two networks unraveling their intertwined structure and confirms the coopetition at stake.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the structure of co­authorship networks’ stability in time. The goal of the article is to analyse differences in the stability and size of groups of researchers that co­author with each other (core research groups) formed in disciplines from the natural and technical sciences on one hand and the social sciences and humanities on the other. The cores were obtained by a pre­specified blockmodeling procedure assuming a multi­core–semi­ periphery–periphery structure. The stability of the obtained cores was measured with the Modified Adjusted Rand Index. The assumed structure was confirmed in all analysed disciplines. The average size of the cores obtained is higher in the second time period and the average core size is greater in the natural and technical sciences than in the social sciences and humanities. There are no differences in average core stability between the natural and technical sciences and the social sciences and humanities. However, if the stability of cores is defined by the splitting of cores and not also by the percentage of researchers who left the cores, the average stability of the cores is higher in disciplines from the scientific fields of Engineering sciences and technologies and Medical sciences than in disciplines of the Humanities, if controlling for the networks’ and disciplines’ characteristics. The analysis was performed on disciplinary co­authorship networks of Slovenian researchers in two time periods (1991–2000 and 2001–2010).",

    "abstract": "Blockmodeling refers to a variety of statistical methods for reducing and simplifying large and complex networks. While methods for blockmodeling networks observed at one time point are well established, it is only recently that researchers have proposed several methods for analysing dynamic networks (i.e., networks observed at multiple time points). The considered approaches are based on k-means or stochastic blockmodeling, with different ways being used to model time dependency among time points. Their novelty means they have yet to be extensively compared and evaluated and the paper therefore aims to compare and evaluate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Different network characteristics are considered, including whether tie formation is random or governed by local network mechanisms. The results show the Dynamic Stochastic Blockmodel (Matias and Miele 2017) performs best if the blockmodel does not change; otherwise, the Stochastic Blockmodel for Multipartite Networks (Bar-Hen et al. 2020) does.",

    "abstract": "The classic formulation of structural balance by Cartwright and Harary (Psychological Review, 63, 1956, 277–293) had the basic structural theorem that a balanced structure could be partitioned into two mutually antagonistic subgroups each having internal solidarity. Davis (Human Relations, 20, 1967, 181–187) extended this theorem for cases where there can be more than two such mutually antagonistic subgroups. We use these theorems to construct a criterion function for a local optimization partitioning procedure for signed digraphs. For any signed digraph, this procedure yields those partitions with the smallest number of errors, a measure of the imbalance in the graph, and an identification of those links inconsistent with both generalized and structural balance. These methods are applied to some artificial data and to the affect data from Sampson (A novitiate in a period of change: An experimental and case study of social relationships, Dissertation, Cornell University, 1968). The latter provides a positive test of a basic tenet of balance theory, that there is a tendency towards balance with signed relations in human groups. While these methods can be applied to all signed digraphs and signed graphs, the balance hypothesis is relevant only for affect ties.",

    "abstract": "Finding communities in complex networks is a challenging task and one promising approach is the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). But the influences from various fields led to a diversity of variants and inference methods. Therefore, a comparison of the existing techniques and an independent analysis of their capabilities and weaknesses is needed. As a first step, we review the development of different SBM variants such as the degree-corrected SBM of Karrer and Newman or Peixoto’s hierarchical SBM. Beside stating all these variants in a uniform notation, we show the reasons for their development. Knowing the variants, we discuss a variety of approaches to infer the optimal partition like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We perform our analysis based on our extension of the Girvan-Newman test and the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark as well as a selection of some real world networks. Using these results, we give some guidance to the challenging task of selecting an inference method and SBM variant. In addition, we give a simple heuristic to determine the number of steps for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithms that lack a usual stop criterion. With our comparison, we hope to guide researches in the field of SBM and highlight the problem of existing techniques to focus future research. Finally, by making our code freely available, we want to promote a faster development, integration and exchange of new ideas.",

Two algorithms have been developed: block EM as part of the maximum likelihood and fuzzy approaches, and block CEM as part of the classification maximum likelihood approach. A unified framework for obtaining different variants of block EM is proposed. These variants are studied and their performances evaluated in comparison with block CEM, two-way EM and two-way CEM, i.e EM and CEM applied separately to the two sets.",

    "abstract": "The power of any kind of network approach lies in the ability to simplify a complex system so that one can better understand its function as a whole. Sometimes it is beneﬁcial, however, to include more information than in a simple graph of only nodes and links. Adding information about times of interactions can make predictions and mechanistic understanding more accurate. The drawback, however, is that there are not so many methods available, partly because temporal networks is a relatively young ﬁeld, partly because it is more diﬃcult to develop such methods compared to for static networks. In this colloquium, we review the methods to analyze and model temporal networks and processes taking place on them, focusing mainly on the last three years. This includes the spreading of infectious disease, opinions, rumors, in social networks; information packets in computer networks; various types of signaling in biology, and more. We also discuss future directions.",

    "abstract": "Scientific collaboration networks have been studied systematically since 1960 by scholars belonging to various disciplinary backgrounds. As a result, the complex phenomenon of scientific collaboration networks has been investigated within different approaches. Although the term “scientific collaboration network” has different connotations in the literature, we use the term more narrowly to focus on scientific collaboration resulting in co-authored public documents. We broaden this beyond journal articles to include many types of scientific productions in addition to journal articles and books. We insist that these productions are public items available in each field. In this chapter, we focus on the main quantitative approaches dealing with the structure and dynamics of scientific collaboration networks through co-authorized publications. We provide a brief history of social network analysis that serves as a foundation. We further review earlier conceptual classifications of co-authorship networks and distinguish cross-disciplinarily, cross-sectoral and cross-national levels. We couple the newer ideas of “small world” models and “preferential attachment” to older sociological conceptions of scientific collaboration. This is followed by descriptions of deterministic and stochastic models that have been used to study dynamic scientific collaboration networks. We stress the importance of delineating the topology of collaboration networks, understanding micro-level processes and then coupling them. We conclude by outlining the strengths and limitations of various modeling strategies.",

    "abstract": "Statistical node clustering in discrete time dynamic networks is an emerging ﬁeld that raises many challenges. Here, we explore statistical properties and frequentist inference in a model that combines a stochastic block model for its static part with independent Markov chains for the evolution of the nodes groups through time. We model binary data as well as weighted dynamic random graphs (with discrete or continuous edges values). Our approach, motivated by the importance of controlling for label switching issues across the different time steps, focuses on detecting groups characterized by a stable within-group connectivity behaviour. We study identiﬁability of the model parameters and propose an inference procedure based on a variational expectation–maximization algorithm as well as a model selection criterion to select the number of groups. We carefully discuss our initialization strategy which plays an important role in the method and we compare our procedure with existing procedures on synthetic data sets. We also illustrate our approach on dynamic contact networks: one of encounters between high school students and two others on animal interactions. An implementation of the method is available as an R package called dynsbm.",

We develop two versions of the method, one using a nonparametric histogram approach with an adaptive choice of the partition size, and the other using kernel intensity estimators.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            In evolving complex systems such as air traffic and social organisations, collective effects emerge from their many components’ dynamic interactions. While the dynamic interactions can be represented by temporal networks with nodes and links that change over time, they remain highly complex. It is therefore often necessary to use methods that extract the temporal networks’ large-scale dynamic community structure. However, such methods are subject to overfitting or suffer from effects of arbitrary, a priori-imposed timescales, which should instead be extracted from data. Here we simultaneously address both problems and develop a principled data-driven method that determines relevant timescales and identifies patterns of dynamics that take place on networks, as well as shape the networks themselves. We base our method on an arbitrary-order Markov chain model with community structure, and develop a nonparametric Bayesian inference framework that identifies the simplest such model that can explain temporal interaction data.",

    "abstract": "Important questions in the social sciences are concerned with the link between micro-level behavior and aggregate macro-level outcomes. This article proposes that studies of the micro-macro link in social systems can utilize conceptual representations and analytical strategies from the field of social networks, and that micro-macro dynamics can be investigated by combining state-of-the-art statistical network models with research strategies from agent-based network modeling. An empirical case study illustrates how stochastic actor-oriented models can be applied as empirically calibrated agent-based simulations. The fruitfulness of this approach is demonstrated by a Schelling-inspired case study on the emergence of segregation in social networks. It is shown that even individuals without homophilous preferences may find themselves in segregated structures due to the complex interaction of different network mechanisms. The example thereby illustrates how social networks can serve as a conceptual and analytical framework to study the micro-macro link in dynamic, interdependent, and multi-mechanistic social systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            In many applications, it is of interest to identify anomalous behavior within a dynamic interacting system. Such anomalous interactions are reflected by structural changes in the network representation of the system. We propose and investigate the use of the degree corrected stochastic block model (DCSBM) to model and monitor dynamic networks that undergo a significant structural change. We apply statistical process monitoring techniques to the estimated parameters of the DCSBM to identify significant structural changes in the network. We apply our surveillance strategy to a dynamic US Senate covoting network. We detect significant changes in the political network that reflect both times of cohesion and times of polarization among Republican and Democratic party members. Our analysis demonstrates that the DCSBM monitoring procedure effectively detects local and global structural changes in complex networks, providing useful insights into the modeled system. The DCSBM approach is an example of a general framework that combines parametric random graph models and statistical process monitoring techniques for network surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the paper is to compare and evaluate different approaches to detecting regular equivalence classes of valued networks. The evaluated approaches include different versions of REGE (indirect approaches) and generalized blockmodeling approaches (direct approaches). In addition to the approaches designed to detect regular equivalence, some approaches designed to detect structural equivalence are also included for comparison. The evaluation is done by means of simulations. Networks of 11 and 25 units were generated based on different known (max-)regular blockmodels and partitions. The obtained partitions were compared to the original (known) partition using the Adjusted Rand Index. The results show that homogeneity blockmodeling, implicit blockmodeling and REGE are usually the best approaches for detecting regular equivalence. The most surprising result is that methods for detecting structural equivalence preformed relatively well on networks generated based on (max)-regular equivalence, better then several approaches designed to detect regular equivalence.",

    "abstract": "One-mode homogeneity blockmodeling is an approach to clustering networks that searches for partitions of units in a network so that the resulting blocks are as homogeneous as possible. Block is a part of the network that contain (possible) ties from the units of one cluster to the units of another cluster (or ties within a cluster). Typically, sum of squared deviations from the mean is taken as the measure of variability (non-homogeneity). The paper presents the results of a simulation study that applied several methods for this problem to binary networks generated according to structural equivalence. Several versions of homogeneity generalized blockmodeling (using a relocation algorithm), a k-means-based algorithm, and an indirect approach are compared. Since all of the methods being compared try to optimize the same criterion function, this and the Adjusted Rand Index are the main criteria for the comparison. All methods (except the indirect approach, which is not iterative) were given the same amount of time to find the best possible solution. The overall conclusion is that the k-means approach is advised in most cases, except when smaller networks (200 units) are being partitioned into larger number of clusters, in which case the homogeneity generalized blockmodeling is preferred.",

Le but de cet article est de discuter de l'entretien cognitif \"penser-à-haute-voix dans une perspective historique et d'esquisser son utilisation et ses limitations dans le contexte du développement et du pré-test des questionnaires Cette technique qualitative est suivie depuis ses précurseurs en psychologie et ses utilisations originales en méthodologie d'enquêtes. Des applications telles que le questionnement rétrospectif, le questionnement de définition, et des questions d'entrainement \"penser-à-haute-voix\" ont été ajoutées à la technique d'une manière adaptée à chaque étude. La technique a aussi été adaptée à des populations différentes, et à des schémas de \"quasi-échantillon\". Les questionnaires auto-administres exigent aussi des adaptations de la technique à l'origine entièrement orale. De plus, la technique est utilisée par des interviewers qui possèdent des niveaux différents d'entrainement. L'implication de ces variations dans l'entretien est examinée. Les définitions de \"cognition\" et de \"processus cognitifs\" implicites dans ces pratiques sont discutées. Les auteurs montrent comment ces définitions ont été étendues pour comprendre des choses telles que le langage usuel, l'interprétation langagière, et la connaissance générale. L'utilité et la nécessité des analyses théoriques sont également discutées.",

We classify the phenomena reviewed into broad categories of remembering what events occurred, remembering when events occurred, and estimation and reconstruction processes used in reporting recurring events. We delineate the contributions of this research for our understanding of memory phenomena and show where this research has revealed gaps in our existing theories and knowledge. These findings present challenges for future collaboration between cognitive psychologists and survey methodologists.",

The number of journals with printed and online versions increased by 13.3% to reach 266 units. The number of Russian journals indexed in Scopus and the Web of Science databases increased during the period, as did the number of journals with both print and online versions.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions:\n              Journals from the RSCI database tend also to be added to Scopus or WoS databases and do not remain exclusively as part of the local database. Implementing the RSCI project had a positive impact on the full spectrum of Russian academic journals, which are increasingly committed to improving their work to continue to be part of RSCI or Scopus or WoS databases.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the journals of the Russian Science Citation Index (RSCI) (Web of Science platform) in respect to publication misconduct and predatory practices.Design/methodology/approach The paper employs formal criteria developed by the Disseropedia of Russian Journals (a.k.a. the Journal Project of the Russian Dissernet).Findings A substantial number of the RSCI journals violate publishing ethics and/or are involved in predatory practices (fake peer-review, plagiarism and self-plagiarism, publication of pseudoscientific papers and so on). The general trend is negative: the number of such journals was higher in July 2018 than in 2015 when the RSCI was launched. The authors propose that this situation is due to the non-transparent and partly defective process of journal selection involved; primarily it can be attributed to problems with the RSCI expert pool.Research limitations/implications Many cases of publication misconduct are inevitably overlooked due to natural limitations of the tools.Originality/value The approach and methods were developed by the Disseropedia of Russian Journals and the Dissernet for the specific local Russian situation, where the scientific and editorial community is corrupt and the institution of reputation does not work properly. The authors believe that the experience may also be helpful for scientists and academic officials from other countries.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The study sought to investigate how Spanish names are handled by national and international databases and to identify mistakes that can undermine the usefulness of these databases for locating and retrieving works by Spanish authors.\nMETHODS: The authors sampled 172 articles published by authors from the University of Granada Medical School between 1987 and 1996 and analyzed the variations in how each of their names was indexed in Science Citation Index (SCI), MEDLINE, and Indice Medico Español (IME). The number and types of variants that appeared for each author's name were recorded and compared across databases to identify inconsistencies in indexing practices. We analyzed the relationship between variability (number of variants of an author's name) and productivity (number of items the name was associated with as an author), the consequences for retrieval of information, and the most frequent indexing structures used for Spanish names.\nRESULTS: The proportion of authors who appeared under more then one name was 48.1% in SCI, 50.7% in MEDLINE, and 69.0% in IME. Productivity correlated directly with variability: more than 50% of the authors listed on five to ten items appeared under more than one name in any given database, and close to 100% of the authors listed on more than ten items appeared under two or more variants. Productivity correlated inversely with retrievability: as the number of variants for a name increased, the number of items retrieved under each variant decreased. For the most highly productive authors, the number of items retrieved under each variant tended toward one. The most frequent indexing methods varied between databases. In MEDLINE and IME, names were indexed correctly as \"first surname second surname, first name initial middle name initial\" (if present) in 41.7% and 49.5% of the records, respectively. However, in SCI, the most frequent method was \"first surname, first name initial second name initial\" (48.0% of the records) and first surname and second surname run together, first name initial (18.3%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Retrievability on the basis of author's name was poor in all three databases. Each database uses accurate indexing methods, but these methods fail to result in consistency or coherence for specific entries. The likely causes of inconsistency are: (1) use by authors of variants of their names during their publication careers, (2) lack of authority control in all three databases, (3) the use of an inappropriate indexing method for Spanish names in SCI, (4) authors' inconsistent behaviors, and (5) possible editorial interventions by some journals. We offer some suggestions as to how to avert the proliferation of author name variants in the databases.",

Numbers are broken down by document type, publication language, type of source, research discipline, country and source. It is concluded that Russian publication counts strongly depend upon the database used, and upon changes in database coverage, and that one should be cautious when using indicators derived from WoS, and especially from Scopus, as tools in the measurement of research performance and international orientation of the Russian science system.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the importance of bibliographic databases (DBs) has increased enormously, as they are the main providers of publication metadata and bibliometric indicators universally used both for research assessment practices and for performing daily tasks. Because the reliability of these tasks ﬁrstly depends on the data source, all users of the DBs should be able to choose the most suitable one. Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus are the two main bibliographic DBs. The comprehensive evaluation of the DBs’ coverage is practically impossible without extensive bibliometric analyses or literature reviews, but most DBs users do not have bibliometric competence and/or are not willing to invest additional time for such evaluations. Apart from that, the convenience of the DB’s interface, performance, provided impact indicators and additional tools may also inﬂuence the users’ choice. The main goal of this work is to provide all of the potential users with an all-inclusive description of the two main bibliographic DBs by gathering the ﬁndings that are presented in the most recent literature and information provided by the owners of the DBs at one place. This overview should aid all stakeholders employing publication and citation data in selecting the most suitable DB.",

    "abstract": "Аннотация\n\t\t\t\t\tРоссийская наука всегда была частью мировой академической среды, успешно сотрудничала и конкурировала с ведущими в научно-техническом развитии странами. Недавняя ситуация с пандемией коронавируса COVID-19 и текущая геополитическая напряженность негативно сказываются на международных научных связях, в связи с чем возникла острая и срочная необходимость перестройки сложившихся партнерств и выстраивания новых. В статье рассматривается феномен участия российских исследователей в международном научном сотрудничестве в контексте существующей глобальной конкуренции и неравенства в науке. В качестве источника данных использовалась база библиографических записей Web of Science за весь доступный период наблюдения с выделением объединенных окон публикаций и цитирования с 2018 по 2022 год. Для оценки влияния публикаций были взяты показатели цитируемости статей и квартилей журналов. Данные о количестве, цитируемости статей и квартилях журналов, в которых они были напечатаны, были извлечены для России, стран Содружества Независимых Государств, группы стран БРИКС и стран-лидеров с наибольшим количеством публикаций. Анализ показал увеличение количества совместных публикаций и положительный эффект соавторства с коллегами, прежде всего, из стран-лидеров научно-технического развития. В статье делается вывод о  необходимости активизации и расширения международного научного сотрудничества за счет новых стран-партнеров.",

By using the Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index, this paper conducts a comparative, dynamic, and empirical study focusing on the use of Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus in academic papers published during 2004 and 2018. This brief communication reveals that although both Web of Science and Scopus are increasingly used in academic papers, Scopus as a new-comer is really challenging the dominating role of WoS. Researchers from more and more countries/regions and knowledge domains are involved in the use of these two databases. Even though the main producers of related papers are developed economies, some developing economies such as China, Brazil and Iran also act important roles but with different patterns in the use of these two databases. Both two databases are widely used in meta-analysis related studies especially for researchers in China. Health/medical science related domains and the traditional Information Science & Library Science field stand out in the use of citation databases.",

Therefore, we conduct a bibliometric analysis using co-citation and pathfinder analysis to describe and visualize the intellectual origins of the field by combining predefined word lists with expert validation. Our results suggest that there are key authors as well as other distinctive characteristics of research that also guides future research. Thematic clusters of the dark side literature suggest heightened emphasis on single dark traits such as narcissism while other constructs such as psychopathy receive little attention. Articles by Tepper can be linked to a central position in the network. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.",

However, researchers have used different terminology to explore phenomena that overlap with abusive supervision, and extant research does not devolve from a unifying theoretical framework. These problems have the potential to undermine the development of knowledge in this important research domain. The author therefore provides a review of the literature that summarizes what is known about the antecedents and consequences of abusive supervision, provides the basis for an emergent model that integrates extant empirical work, and suggests directions for future research.",

A model of the individual and situa‐tional antecedents of petty tyranny in organizations and the effects of tyranny on subordinates is presented. The model is assessed via 63 sets of respondents, each consisting of one manager and two subordinates, plus 25 partial sets. The hypothesized effects are generally supported, but not the hypothesized antecedents. It is speculated that petty tyranny represents a relatively rare gestalt, that is, an integrated and resilient cluster of antecedents, leader behaviours, and effects on subordinates.\n            \n            \n              Résumé\n              On entend par “petite tyrannie” la tendance à exercer une domination sur les autres. L'article présente un modèle des antécédents individuels et situationnels de la petite tyrannie dans les organisations et des effects de la tyrannie sur les subordonnés. Le modèle est testé à par‐tir de 63 groupes complets de répondants, composés chacun d'un chef de service et de deux subordonnés, et de 25 groupes partiels. Les hypothèses liées aux effets de la tyrannie sont généralement verifiées contrairement à celles des antécédents. L'auteur suggère que la petite tyrannie représente une “gestalt” relativement rare, c'est‐à‐dire un ensemble intégré d'antécédents, de com‐portements de leader et d'effets sur les subordonnés.",

    "abstract": "A significant stream of research taking a psychoanalytic perspective has focused on leadership in organizations. Studies have investigated, from a Freudian perspective, leader–follower relations where the leader represents a domineering and authoritarian father figure. We contribute to this research by introducing Lacanian theory to explore the increasingly influential ‘authentic leadership’ approach. In contrast to traditional leadership, this approach advocates, in line with postmodern trends, a post-heroic, non-authoritarian and even self-effacing leader figure. In analysing academic and practitioner-oriented authentic leadership texts we ask, drawing on Lacanian insights, whether authentic leadership enables subjects to separate from the master discourse of traditional leadership through promoting something like the analyst discourse, or whether it entails the return of a phantasmagorical Freudian primal father figure, leading to heightened dependency. In so doing, we discuss the political significance of Lacanian theory in illuminating possibilities for more autonomous and emancipatory relations in organizations.",

    "abstract": "Psychoanalytic approaches to leadership centre on emotions and the role of the leader as the manager of emotion (Gabriel, 2011). These perspectives have often focused on the dysfunctions of leadership, the way in which leaders contribute to ‘dark’ and unhealthy organizational lives. In contrast to such approaches, in this paper we draw from Christophe Dejours’ psychodynamic theory of work, in order to explore what role leaders could play to facilitate health in organizations. We first begin by providing a short overview of some psychoanalytic perspectives on leadership. We show that such approaches illuminate the emotions and fantasies entailed in leadership or in the bonds between leaders and followers. We then discuss Dejours’ psychodynamic theory, which provides a different view. This theory does not focus on the emotions and fantasies associated with leadership, but instead demonstrates the role of work in the affective and social life of the subject and the implications this has for leading/managing workers.",

It advances the idea that leadership identities are imaginary constructions that invariable fail, reiterating a lack of being. Empirical material consisting of interviews with 15 leaders is used to explore the productive role this lack plays. The study suggests that leadership identities are always already subverted by unconscious desire and therefore less powerful than we might think with regard to imposing structures on others, but also much more powerful than we might think as liberating struggles with leaders’ imaginary selves.",

A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results.  We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.",

    "abstract": "We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a ﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an inﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efﬁcient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classiﬁcation, and collaborative ﬁltering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.",

    "abstract": "Целью работы является выделение актуальных тематик в социологии XX – начала XXI века посредством анализа публикаций в десяти ведущих англоязычных общесоциологических журналах. Исследование выполнено в количественной парадигме изучения научного знания и основано на анализе библиографической информации о публикациях из базы данных Web of Science (более 23 тыс. публикаций). Собранные данные стали основой для построения сети цитирований между публикациями. Используя метрики сетевого анализа и алгоритм выделения основного пути в этой сети, мы получаем работы с наибольшим количеством цитирований, которые можно считать наиболее значимыми для авторов отобранных журналов, прослеживаем связи между статьями и делаем выводы об актуальных тематиках исследований, преобладающих в определенном сегменте социологии в тот или иной период времени.\nБлагодарность. Исследование финансировалось в рамках государственной поддержки ведущих университетов Российской Федерации «5-100».\nАвторы выражают благодарность анонимным рецензентам за комментарии к предыдущим версиям статьи, а также Станиславу Моисееву (НИУ ВШЭ) за идеи по улучшению текущей версии текста.",

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to determine the relative importance of individual- and park-related characteristics in influencing both local park use and specific engagement in active sports, walking and sedentary pursuits. We surveyed 3815 adults living within 0.80 km of one of 24 study parks in four US metropolitan areas. Chi-square statistics and baseline-category logit models examined how perceived safety and park characteristics were related to park visitation and types of park activities, controlling for city, individual and park characteristics. Survey participants who perceived the parks as safe (88%) had 4.6 times the odds (95% CI 3.5–6.0) of reporting having visited the study park. Men and African Americans were more likely, and older individuals and those who self-reported being in fair or poor health less likely to perceive parks as safe. Parks having low incivilities scores and those with four or more different facilities, such as tennis courts, swimming pools, basketball courts, etc., were more likely than parks with fewer facilities to be perceived as safe. While park facilities had a much smaller odds ratio for predicting park visits (1.8), it affected 70% of the population. The implication is, if these associations are causal, modifying park facilities may have a greater population impact than improving perceptions of park safety. Our findings are consistent with studies suggesting that increasing the variety of park facilities and offering more organised activities may encourage physical activity among specific target groups.",

    "abstract": "This article discusses the place of qualitative network analysis in the strategy of mixing methods in the social sciences. We conducted a systematic review of the literature that allowed us to demonstrate examples of the use of qualitative network analysis in empirical research. There are four ways of analyzing qualitative data in network mixed studies: qualitative analysis of qualitative data, quantitative analysis of qualitative data, quantitative and qualitative analysis of qualitative data and quantitative and qualitative analysis of qualitative and quantitative data. Currently, there is a lack of a single definition of the methodology of qualitative network analysis and consensus on its implementation in practice. The main possibilities of qualitative network analysis are discussed in the article. At the level of the research object, qualitative network analysis studies the personal networks of individuals’ relationships, and also make easier an access to hard-to-reach groups of respondents. At the level of the subject of research, qualitative network analysis allows us to study the deep meanings of relationships in the network and the contexts of interaction, to describe and understand networks from the inside and outside, to focus on the activities of actors and their strategies for building a network, as well as to identify the temporality of relationships in the network. The article discusses a position that questions the existence of qualitative network analysis as an independent methodology.",

    "abstract": "Social network analysis was formed and established in the 1970s as a way of analyzing systems of social relations. In this review the theoretical-methodological standpoint of social network analysis ('structural analysis') is introduced and the different forms of social network analysis are presented. Structural analysis argues that social actors and social relations are embedded in social networks, meaning that action and perception of actors as well as the performance of social relations are influenced by the network structure. Since the 1990s structural analysis has integrated concepts such as agency, discourse and symbolic orientation and in this way structural analysis has opened itself. Since then there has been increasing use of qualitative methods in network analysis. They are used to include the perspective of the analyzed actors, to explore networks, and to understand network dynamics. In the reviewed book, edited by Betina HOLLSTEIN and Florian STRAUS, the twenty predominantly empirically orientated contributions demonstrate the possibilities of combining quantitative and qualitative methods in network analyses in different research fields. In this review we examine how the contributions succeed in applying and developing the structural analysis perspective, and the self-positioning of 'qualitative network analysis' is evaluated.",

Despite some limitations discussed in the article, the study illustrates that an applied methodological approach has a potential to overcome some of the pitfalls of ‘structural determinism’ by looking both at structural and contextual aspects as well as actors’ active role in accessing and (re)shaping their business‐related networks across different geographic spaces. The article demonstrates that qualitative social network analysis is particularly valuable for emphasizing the role of human agency and temporal changes of social relations both in terms of network composition and network content as well as for exploring the meaning attached to social ties, potential access barriers to certain types of social capital and strategies to overcome these barriers.",

The volume provides readers with methodological concepts to guide mixed-methods network studies with precise research designs and methods to investigate social networks of various sorts. Each chapter describes the research design used and discusses the strengths of the methods for that particular field and for specific outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Using the approach of qualitative social network research, this article focuses on two ‘systems of social inequality’ on the basis of which learning is organized: one is the institutional and organizational framework structuring the encounters between teachers and students, the other is a system of social inequality incorporated at the level of emotions and affections. Both systems seem to be virtually inevitable and, due to the tacit nature of their workings in class interactions, escape attempts at deliberate control. The article demonstrates how the web of social relationships in the early grades acts to reinforce both systems of social inequality and how they mutually affect one another in the class setting. Two first grade classes were studied for this purpose using mixed methods. The findings clearly support these conclusions: in both classes under study, a configuration of relationships consisting of a range of distinct (student) positions has emerged, and all parties involved have a similar perception of this social configuration. These social positions, each of which offer different opportunities for learning, are reflected both in interactions (as evidenced by video analysis) and the students’ stories (as evidenced in interviews). Such stabilization processes determine student careers early on and render the class setting ‘porous’ as a space of learning.",

    "abstract": "Academic collaboration networks can be formed by grouping different faculty members into a single group. Grouping these faculty members together is a complex process that involves searching multiple web pages in order to collect and analyze information, and establishing new connections among prospective collaborators. A recommender system (RS) for academic collaborations can help reduce the time and effort required to establish a new collaboration. Content-based recommendation system make recommendations based on similarity without taking social context into consideration. Hybrid recommender systems can be used to combine similarity and social context. In this paper, we propose a weighting method that can be used to combine two or more social context factors in a recommendation engine that leverages an exponential random graph model (ERGM) based on historical network data. We demonstrate our approach using real data from collaborations with faculty members at the College of Computer and Information Sciences (CCIS) in Saudi Arabia. Our results demonstrate that weighting social context factors helps increase recommendation accuracy for new users.",

    "abstract": "[A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly.]",

Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad-hoc modular networks. .",

Unfortunately, analysts often treat the time series properties of their data as a nuisance rather than a substantively meaningful dynamic process to be modeled and interpreted. Time Series Analysis for the Social Sciences provides accessible, up-to-date instruction and examples of the core methods in time series econometrics. Janet M. Box-Steffensmeier, John R. Freeman, Jon C. Pevehouse and Matthew P. Hitt cover a wide range of topics including ARIMA models, time series regression, unit-root diagnosis, vector autoregressive models, error-correction models, intervention models, fractional integration, ARCH models, structural breaks, and forecasting. This book is aimed at researchers and graduate students who have taken at least one course in multivariate regression. Examples are drawn from several areas of social science, including political behavior, elections, international conflict, criminology, and comparative political economy.",

    "abstract": "Social behavior over short time scales is frequently understood in terms of actions, which can be thought of as discrete events in which one individual emits a behavior directed at one or more other entities in his or her environment (possibly including himself or herself). Here, we introduce a highly flexible framework for modeling actions within social settings, which permits likelihood-based inference for behavioral mechanisms with complex dependence. Examples are given for the parameterization of base activity levels, recency, persistence, preferential attachment, transitive/cyclic interaction, and participation shifts within the relational event framework. Parameter estimation is discussed both for data in which an exact history of events is available, and for data in which only event sequences are known. The utility of the framework is illustrated via an application to dynamic modeling of responder radio communications during the early hours of the World Trade Center disaster.",

    "abstract": "The stochastic actor oriented model (SAOM) is a method for modelling social interactions and social behaviour over time. It can be used to model network effects using both exogenous covariates and endogenous network configurations, but also the co-evolution of behaviour and social interactions. The estimation method mostly used is the Method of Moments (MoM). The model assumption that all individuals have the same evaluation function, however, is one of its limitations. The aim of this paper is to generalize the MoM estimation method for the SAOM to include random effects, so that the heterogeneity of individuals can be modelled more accurately. The linear evaluation function that models the probability of forming or removing a tie from the network, is decomposed in a fixed part, which is the current evaluation function of the SAOM, and a random part, with parameters that are individual-specific and random. The Robbins-Monro algorithm that is commonly used for MoM estimation in the SAOM, is extended to allow the estimation of the variance of the random parameters. We illustrate how for the model with random out-degree we can estimate the parameter of the random components, and how to test its significance. An application is made to Kapferer's Tailor shop dataset. It is shown that including a random out-degree constitutes a serious alternative to including various transitivity effects.",

    "abstract": "Patent Citation Analysis has been gaining considerable traction over the past few decades. In this paper, we collect extensive information on patents and citations and provide a perspective of citation network analysis of patents from a statistical viewpoint. We identify and analyze the most cited patents, the most innovative and the highly cited companies along with the structural properties of the network by providing in-depth descriptive analysis. Furthermore, we employ Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze the citation networks. ERGMs enables understanding the social perspectives of a patent citation network which has not been studied earlier. We demonstrate that social properties such as homophily (the inclination to cite patents from the same country or in the same language) and transitivity (the inclination to cite references’ references) together with the technicalities of the patents (\n              e.g.,\n              language, categories), has a significant effect on citations. We also provide an in-depth analysis of citations for sectors in patents and how it is affected by the size of the same. Overall, our paper delves into European patents with the aim of providing new insights and serves as an account for fitting ERGMs on large networks and analyzing them. ERGMs help us model network mechanisms directly, instead of acting as a proxy for unspecified dependence and relationships among the observations.",

    "abstract": "This study uses recent data to investigate if smoking initiation diffuses through friendship networks over the high school period and explores if diffusion processes differ across schools. One thousand four hundred and twenty-five racially and ethnically diverse youth from four high schools in Los Angeles were surveyed four times over the high school period from 2010 to 2013. Probit regression models and stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics tested for peer effects on smoking initiation. Friend smoking was found to predict adolescent smoking, and smoking initiation diffused through friendship networks in some but not all of the schools. School differences in smoking rates and the popularity of smokers may be linked to differences in the diffusion of smoking through peer networks. We conclude that there are differences in peer effects on smoking initiation across schools that will be important to account for in network-based smoking interventions.",

    "abstract": "Research on co-evolution of networks and behavior became possible with the emergence of student performance and behavior dynamic data collection and storage tools, as well as with the development of new social network analysis methods. Dynamic network analysis answers the question, how specific forms of student behavior, like bad habits, develop and propagate. It is also helpful in following how school or university students enter into friendship or antagonism with each other, as well as in assessing the impact social relations have on academic performance. The paper gives a review of the two key methods used for empirical analysis of social network dynamics. Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOM) represent one of the most elaborated techniques of social network dynamics investigation. This approach regards the present state of a network as dependable on its preceding state uniquely. Network evolution appears to be continuous, not discrete, so that a structural macro change is, in fact, a multitude of micro changes. Instead of dealing with structure of the network and prerequisites for its development, the SAOM model studies the processes underlying any changes recorded. Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (STERGM) are an alternative approach towards research on social network dynamics. In this case, the social network observed is a materialization of one of possible networks with predetermined characteristics. Any network develops in the result of a stochastic process, and the research should be aimed at discovering what forces this process is driven by. Comparison of an empirically discovered network with networks of similar size reveals structural features of the network and characteristics of actors who influenced the process of its establishment. In this paper, we also give an example of how both models can be used with the same set of data.",

    "abstract": "Human behavior depends on many factors including the social environment. Over the past decades, scholars have actively developed models that evaluate the impact of the environment on the individual. This article describes stochastic actor-oriented modeling (SAOM) which allows to test hypotheses about the structural evolution of social networks, as well as to analyze the co-evolution of networks and behavior in detail. The authors present theoretical and methodological foundations of SAOM; specify requirements for research design and data collection; consider the specification of the model and an example of co-evolution of the network and academic achievement of students; point out limitations of the method, and suggest promising avenues for further research. The article concludes that using SAOM is preferable for small social networks with low rotation, in particular, for organizational units and study groups. The authors argue that the existing studies mainly consider the educational context and social networks of young people that does not allow to draw conclusions about the evolution of social ties in communities of a different type and other age groups. In addition, most of the research is based on data collected in Western democracies which indicates the need to investigate a variety of samples.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the collaboration structures and dynamics of the co-authorship network of all Slovenian researchers. Its goal is to identify the key factors driving collaboration and the main differences in collaboration behavior across scientific fields and disciplines. Two approaches to modelling network dynamics are combined in this paper: the small-world model and the mechanism of preferential attachment, also known as the process of cumulative advantage. Stochastic-actor-based modelling of co-authorship network dynamics uses data for the complete longitudinal co-authorship networks for the entire Slovenian scientific community from 1996 to 2010. We confirmed the presence of clustering in all fields and disciplines. Preferential attachment is far more complex than a single global mechanism. There were two clear distinctions regarding collaboration within scientific fields and disciplines. One was that some fields had an internal national saturation inhibiting further collaboration. The second concerned the differential impact of collaboration with scientists from abroad on domestic collaboration. In the natural, technical, medical, and biotechnical sciences, this promotes collaboration within the Slovenian scientific community while in the social sciences and humanities this inhibits internal collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Innovation is the engine for the sustainable development of cities and regions, and an innovation perspective is used to study the collaborative innovation relationship between regional cities and the evolution mechanism of regional innovation network formation. Based on the social network analysis method and spatial analysis method, we explore the characteristics of the regional research cooperation network and its spatial pattern, as well as analyze the formation mechanism of the network using the exponential random graph model. The study finds that the scale of the regional innovation network is expanding, the overall network density is gradually increasing, but the nodes are loosely linked, and the regional innovation network is in the stage of deepening development. There is spatial heterogeneity in the regional innovation network, with a dumbbell-shaped distribution of “double-core dominance and central collapse”. During the formation of the regional innovation network, the endogenous structure of the innovation network is multi-connected under the path dependence, and the network development tends to be complicated; the economic strength and scientific research capability of cities and multi-dimensional proximity have a positive influence on the formation of the innovation network, and geographical proximity, social proximity and cognitive proximity can promote intra-regional innovation cooperation.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. We examined the coevolution of adolescent friendships and peer influences with respect to their risk behaviors and social networking site use.\n            Methods. Investigators of the Social Network Study collected longitudinal data during fall 2010 and spring 2011 from 10th-grade students in 5 Southern California high schools (n = 1434). We used meta-analyses of stochastic actor-based models to estimate changes in friendship ties and risk behaviors and the effects of Facebook and MySpace use.\n            Results. Significant shifts in adolescent smoking and drinking occurred despite little change in overall prevalence rates. Students with higher levels of alcohol use were more likely to send and receive friendship nominations and become friends with other drinkers. They were also more likely to increase alcohol use if their friends drank more. Adolescents selected friends with similar Facebook and MySpace use habits. Exposure to friends’ risky online pictures increased smoking behaviors but had no significant effects on alcohol use.\n            Conclusions. Our findings support a greater focus on friendship selection mechanisms in school-based alcohol use interventions. Social media platforms may help identify at-risk adolescent groups and foster positive norms about risk behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic actor-oriented (SAO) models are a family of models for network dynamics that enable researchers to test multiple, often competing explanations for network change and estimate the extent and relative power of various influences on network evolution. SAO models for the co-evolution of network ties and actor behavior, the most comprehensive category of SAO models, examine how networks and actor attributes—their behavior, performance, or attitudes—influence each other over time. While these models have been widely used in the social sciences, and particularly in educational settings, their use in organizational scholarship has been extremely limited. This paper provides a layperson introduction to SAO models for the co-evolution of networks and behavior and the types of research questions they can address. The models and their underpinnings are explained in nonmathematical terms, and theoretical explanations are supported by a concrete, detailed example that includes step-by-step model building and hypothesis testing, alongside an R script.",

Based on the data from the Facebook group, which consists of 7 years of communication from 2011 till 2018, we constructed the networks based on commenting and reacting. The participants activity includes four main periods for stability evaluation of the community. The blockmodeling discloses the structural patterns of interactions in the community. The results show the \"core-periphery\" type of the global structure. The core and periphery are structured differently in the networks of comments and reactions. The stability between the positions in the global structure is high and while the structure may vary in some periods, the size of the core and periphery fluctuates. However, the stability within the positions of the global structure is low, according to the modified Rand index (Cugmas, Ferligoj, 2018).",

    "abstract": "Cooperation helps states realize mutual gains, but mistrust and disagreements over institutional design inhibit cooperation. This article develops a network explanation for how states achieve cooperation in the face of persistent coordination and collaboration problems. The analysis focuses on bilateral cooperation agreements, a vast body of treaties spanning multiple issue areas. Bilateral agreements constitute an evolving network of cooperative ties. This network defines the strategic environment in which states bargain over new agreements, endogenously influencing subsequent bilateral endeavors by revealing strategically valuable information about states’ trustworthiness and preferences over institutional design, while also generating externalities that incentivize bilateral partnerships. Inferential network analysis shows that states are more likely to create bilateral agreements if they (1) share agreements with common third parties, (2) accede to more agreements in general, and/or (3) share important exogenous characteristics with current bilateral partners. These network dynamics drive bilateral cooperation in everything from commodities to cultural exchange to fisheries.",

The sample included 1419 Finnish secondary education students (690 males and 729 females, mean age 16 years at the outset) from nine schools. Participants identified three school friends and described their alcohol and tobacco use on two occasions one year apart. Actor‐based models simultaneously examined changes in peer network ties and changes in individual behaviors for all participants within each school. Multi‐level analyses examined changes in individual behaviors for adolescents entering new peer groups and adolescents in stable peer groups, both of which were embedded within the school‐based peer networks. Similar results emerged from both analytic methods:\n              Selection\n              and\n              socialization\n              contributed to similarity of alcohol use, but only\n              selection\n              was a factor in tobacco use.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            Even in diverse schools that provide opportunities for interreligious friendships, Muslim youth disproportionally tend to be friends with Muslims rather than non-Muslims. Echoing broader debates about minorities’ self-segregation versus exclusion by majority group members, a key question is whether religious friendship segregation arises because of Muslims’ in-group bias or because of non-Muslims’ reluctance to befriend them. We suggest that the answer differs for Muslim boys and girls. Building on research on interreligious romantic relations and accounts of the lives of young Muslims and other ethno-religious minorities in Western societies, we propose that religious in-group bias is stronger for Muslim girls than for Muslim boys. Conversely, we expect non-Muslim youth to be more open to befriend Muslim girls than Muslim boys. Applying stochastic actor-oriented models of network dynamics to large-scale longitudinal data of friendship networks in German schools, we find that Muslim girls indeed have a strong in-group bias, whereas non-Muslim youth are not reluctant to be friends with them. Muslim boys, by contrast, have a much weaker in-group bias, but non-Muslim youth are less willing to be friends with them rather than with non-Muslims. A simulation analysis demonstrates that these gendered individual-level processes result in comparable aggregate patterns of friendship segregation among Muslim boys and girls. Religious friendship segregation thus arises because Muslim girls tend to self-segregate and non-Muslim youth are less willing to befriend Muslim boys although the latter are open to interreligious friendships. This gendered friendship-making behavior has implications for the larger question of minority social integration.",

The distribution of these components is not restricted to be normal; this allows a broader class of models, which includes generalized linear mixed models.

This avoids the integration that is necessary when marginal likelihood is used. Under appropriate conditions maximizing the\n              h\n              ‐likelihood gives fixed effect estimators that are asymptotically equivalent to those obtained from the use of marginal likelihood; at the same time we obtain the random effect estimates that are asymptotically best unbiased predictors. An adjusted profile\n              h\n              ‐likelihood is shown to give the required generalization of restricted maximum likelihood for the estimation of dispersion components. A scaled deviance test for the goodness of fit, a model selection criterion for choosing between various dispersion models and a graphical method for checking the distributional assumption of random effects are proposed. The ideas of quasi‐likelihood and extended quasi‐likelihood are generalized to the new class. We give examples of the Poisson–gamma, binomial–beta and gamma–inverse gamma hierarchical generalized linear models. A resolution is proposed for the apparent difference between population‐averaged and subject‐specific models. A unified framework is provided for viewing and extending many existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            The temporal exponential random graph model (TERGM) and the stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM, e.g., SIENA) are popular models for longitudinal network analysis. We compare these models theoretically, via simulation, and through a real-data example in order to assess their relative strengths and weaknesses. Though we do not aim to make a general claim about either being superior to the other across all specifications, we highlight several theoretical differences the analyst might consider and find that with some specifications, the two models behave very similarly, while each model out-predicts the other one the more the specific assumptions of the respective model are met.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the influence of different types of diversity, both observable and unobservable, on the creation of innovative ideas. Our framework draws on theory and research on information processing, social categorization, coordination, and homophily to posit the influence of cognitive, gender, and country diversity on innovation. Our longitudinal model is based on a unique data set of 1,354 researchers who helped create the new scientific field of oncofertility, by collaborating on 469 publications over a 4-year period. We capture the differences among researchers along cognitive, country, and gender dimensions, as well as examine how the resulting diversity or homophily influences the formation of collaborative innovation networks. We find that innovation, operationalized as publishing in a new scientific discipline, benefits from both homophily and diversity. Homophily in country of residence and working with prior collaborators help reduce uncertainty in the interactions associated with innovation, while diversity in knowledge enables the recombinant knowledge required for innovation.",

While this project aimed to make leading Russian universities more globally competitive and improve their research productivity, it also happened to increase their cooperation. An analysis of affiliations and the co-authorship networks was conducted to explore scientific collaborations between and within the participating universities. Such analysis facilitates the investigation of the number of collaborations with other organizations, both domestic and international cooperation, and disciplinary differences. By analyzing the co-authorship networks, the position of universities in the academic network and the structure of collaborations among the participants were examined. A sample of 30 Russian universities, including participants in Project 5-100 and a control group of institutions with similar characteristics, was used. After joining the project, the participating universities increased both their cooperation with each other as well as with foreign universities and research institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences, especially in the high-quality segment. At the same time, the collaboration patterns of non-participating universities did not change significantly. The centrality of Project 5-100 universities in the global academic network has increased, along with their visibility and coupling in the national network. The historical division between university and academic sectors has diminished, while the participating universities have started to play a more important role in knowledge production within the country.",

Self‐administered questionnaires were distributed among 2nd–4th graders (mean ages = 14.2–16.2 years) during spring 2006. Follow‐up was conducted 12 months later. Data was analyzed conducting longitudinal social network analyses. Results showed adolescents perceiving high parental psychological control had a significant higher tendency to select smoking friends. Perceived behavioral control and perceived parental support did not affect the selection of smoking friends. Furthermore, maternal smoking behavior affected the selection of smoking friends, although no effect of paternal smoking behavior on the selection of smoking friends was found. Adolescent smoking prevention efforts should focus on the influence of parents through their smoking behavior and their psychological control to decrease adolescents' tendency to select smoking friends resulting in fewer opportunities for negative peer influences to occur.",

An electronic search was conducted on Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases, combining relevant keywords. After the studies’ selection, 27 studies were included. The results show the interest in using context-aware features to develop smart cities’ applications targeting public health, tourism experience, urban mobility, active citizenship, shopping experience, management of urban infrastructures, public alerts, recommenders, and smart environments. Moreover, the applications reported by the included studies do not allow the execution of actions without the explicit consent of the users, and they integrate personal sensors, sensors deployed in the city and crowdsourcing mechanisms to acquire primary context attributes (i.e., location, activity, and environment) and secondary context attributes (i.e., speed, physical activity, points of interest, stress, and tourists’ emotions). In addition, the included studies present scarce details about context reasoning, data privacy, integrity, and confidentiality, data aggregation and accuracy, and data interoperability. Finally, the results also indicate low maturity level of the developed applications, which is evidenced by the lack of user-centred evaluations, as well as by the difficulty in integrating important technologies being developed for smart cities.",

    "abstract": "For years, organizational communication scholars have been interested in the mechanisms that influence the formation of communication networks. One way to gain a deeper insight into the factors that shape such networks is to model them using exponential random graph modeling (ERGM). However, ERGM has only been applicable to binary networks, reducing communication to something that is either present or not. This article illustrates valued ERGM for organizational communication networks that have a weight associated with each tie. Using a data set on friendship strength between collaborative scientists, results show there are important differences when the network is modeled as binary versus when modeled as valued. In particular, the valued model showed that scientists are more selective regarding friendship (less outdegree activity). Moreover, there were several differences regarding how popular certain disciplines were over others. An online appendix with the R code and data is also included.",

We describe inter-personal conflicts and assess theories of coalition formation in a small-scale human society. Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional social network analysis of men in two communities of Tsimane forager–horticulturalists, we find evidence of reciprocity in coalitional support, as well as evidence of transitivity: an ally of my ally is likely to become my ally. We find mixed support for coalition formation between individuals who share a common adversary. Coalition formation was also predicted by food- and labour-sharing and especially by kinship. Physically formidable men and men higher in informal status were more likely to provide coalitional support over time; evidence was mixed that they receive more coalitional support. The highest status men are hubs of a dense coalitional support network that indirectly link all men in the community. These findings suggest that male coalition formation is multiply motivated, and in general reveals the political dynamics that structure men's lives in small, relatively egalitarian communities.",

We find that different digital technologies may have varying impacts on freedom while affecting its diffusion via different political networks, and that related changes in civil liberties can be affected by both media freedom and internal political institutions. Our analysis suggests three key mechanisms linking information technology with democratic change and highlights the importance of a country's “susceptibility” to political influence that is triggered by greater digitally induced visibility.",

The measurement model is based on two assumptions. (1) The observed network is generated by hierarchically nested latent transitive structures, expressed by ultrametrics, and (2) the expected tie strength decreases with ultrametric distance. The approach could be described as model-based clustering with an ultrametric space as the underlying metric to capture the dependence in the observations. Bayesian methods as well as maximum-likelihood methods are applied for statistical inference. Both approaches are implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            This paper provides an examination of inter-organizational collaboration in the UK research system. Data are collected on organizational collaboration on projects funded by four key UK research councils: Arts and Humanities Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. The organizational partnerships include both academic and nonacademic institutions. A collaboration network is created for each research council, and an exponential random graph model is applied to inform on the mechanisms underpinning collaborative tie formation on research council-funded projects. We find that in the sciences, collaborative patterns are much more hierarchical and concentrated in a small handful of actors compared to the social sciences and humanities projects. Institutions that are members of the elite Russell Group (a set of 24 high-ranking UK universities) are much more likely to be involved in collaborations across research councils.",

The distributions depend on a function which may be viewed as giving the potential energy of the configurations. Examples include models for interaction in a spatial region and on lattices and graphs. New models in the general class arise naturally, an example being a spatial model for points of different categories. Some general methods, including series expansions and a simulation method known from statistical mechanics, can be useful for many of these models. Several applications of this kind are considered, and some connections between the models and with the statistical mechanics are explored.]",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.",

    "abstract": "We propose a class of actor-oriented statistical models for closed social networks in general, and friendship networks in particular. The models are random utility models developed within a rational choice framework. Based on social psychological and sociological theories about friendship, mathematical functions capturing expected utility of individual actors with respect to friendship are constructed. Expected utility also contains a random (unexplained) component. We assume that, given their restrictions and contact opportunities, individuals evaluate their utility functions and behave such that they maximize the expected amount of utility. The behavior under consideration is the expression of like and dislike (choice of friends). Theoretical mechanisms that are modelled are, e.g., the principle of diminishing returns, the tendency towards reciprocated choices, and the preference for friendship relations with similar others. Constraints imposed on individuals are, e.g., the structure of the existing network, and the distribution of personal characteristics over the respondents. The models are illustrated by means of a data-set collected among university freshmen at 7 points in time during 1994 and 1995.",

    "abstract": "Academic networks are expected to enhance scientific collaboration and thereby increase research outputs. However, little is known about whether and how the initial steps of getting to know other researchers translates into effective collaborations. In this paper, we investigate the evolution and co-evolution of an academic social network and a collaborative research network (using co-authorship as a proxy measure of the latter), and simultaneously examine the effect of individual researcher characteristics (e.g. gender, seniority or workplace) on their evolving relationships. We used longitudinal data from an international network in primary care cancer research: the CanTest Collaborative (CanTest). Surveys were distributed amongst CanTest researchers to map who knows who (the ‘academic social network’). Co-authorship relations were derived from Scopus (the ‘collaborative network’). Stochastic actor-oriented models were employed to investigate the evolution and co-evolution of both networks. Visualizing the development of the CanTest network revealed that researchers within CanTest get to know each other quickly and also start collaborating over time (evolution of the academic social network and collaborative network respectively). Results point to a stable and solid academic social network that is particularly encouraging towards more junior researchers; yet differing for male and female researchers (the effect of individual researcher characteristics). Moreover, although the academic social network and the research collaborations do not grow at the same pace, the benefit of creating academic social relationships to stimulate effective research collaboration is clearly demonstrated (co-evolution of both networks).",

    "abstract": "The democracy-science relationship has traditionally been examined through philosophical conjecture and country case studies. There remains limited global-scale empirical research on the topic. This study explores country-level factors related to the dynamics of the global research collaboration network, focusing on structural associations between democratic governance and the strength of international research collaboration ties. This study combines longitudinal data on 170 countries between 2008 and 2017 from the Varieties of Democracy Institute, World Bank Indicators, Scopus, and Web of Science bibliometric data. Methods include descriptive network analysis, temporal exponential random graph models (TERGM), and valued exponential random graph models (VERGM). The results suggest significant positive effects of democratic governance on the formation and strength of international research collaboration ties and homophily between countries with similar levels of democratic governance. The results also show the importance of exogenous factors, such as GDP, population size, and geographical distance, as well as endogenous network factors, including preferential attachment and transitivity.",

    "abstract": "The development of smart cities is a clear growing trend all around the world. The convergence of different technological, social, political, economical, and ecological trends has allowed the concepts to rise up quickly in governmental agendas. In this paper, we analyze the situation of Russia regarding smart cities. Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Kazan are considered at the “Smart City 3.0” stage of development, meaning that the citizens are participating in their advancement. Our reasons to focus on Russia are two-fold: (1) we know the situation well, as we live and work in a new city, Innopolis, founded in 2015 and meant to be a blueprint for smart cities; (2) large Russian cities are actively developing projects in this sphere and are highly regarded worldwide in these endeavors. It is therefore worth analyzing the context and the trends. By studying the scientific literature and categorizing the features of smart cities the world over, we found that large Russian cities are developing most of the components necessary in order to be called smart. Herein we also discuss areas of possible growth for Russian cities, such as green technologies and a smart environment.",

    "abstract": "Academic collaboration networks can be formed by grouping different faculty members into a single group. Grouping these faculty members together is a complex process that involves searching multiple web pages in order to collect and analyze information, and establishing new connections among prospective collaborators. A recommender system (RS) for academic collaborations can help reduce the time and effort required to establish a new collaboration. Content-based recommendation system make recommendations based on similarity without taking social context into consideration. Hybrid recommender systems can be used to combine similarity and social context. In this paper, we propose a weighting method that can be used to combine two or more social context factors in a recommendation engine that leverages an exponential random graph model (ERGM) based on historical network data. We demonstrate our approach using real data from collaborations with faculty members at the College of Computer and Information Sciences (CCIS) in Saudi Arabia. Our results demonstrate that weighting social context factors helps increase recommendation accuracy for new users.",

    "abstract": "[A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly.]",

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection method in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad-hoc modular networks. .",

Unfortunately, analysts often treat the time series properties of their data as a nuisance rather than a substantively meaningful dynamic process to be modeled and interpreted. Time Series Analysis for the Social Sciences provides accessible, up-to-date instruction and examples of the core methods in time series econometrics. Janet M. Box-Steffensmeier, John R. Freeman, Jon C. Pevehouse and Matthew P. Hitt cover a wide range of topics including ARIMA models, time series regression, unit-root diagnosis, vector autoregressive models, error-correction models, intervention models, fractional integration, ARCH models, structural breaks, and forecasting. This book is aimed at researchers and graduate students who have taken at least one course in multivariate regression. Examples are drawn from several areas of social science, including political behavior, elections, international conflict, criminology, and comparative political economy.",

    "abstract": "Social behavior over short time scales is frequently understood in terms of actions, which can be thought of as discrete events in which one individual emits a behavior directed at one or more other entities in his or her environment (possibly including himself or herself). Here, we introduce a highly flexible framework for modeling actions within social settings, which permits likelihood-based inference for behavioral mechanisms with complex dependence. Examples are given for the parameterization of base activity levels, recency, persistence, preferential attachment, transitive/cyclic interaction, and participation shifts within the relational event framework. Parameter estimation is discussed both for data in which an exact history of events is available, and for data in which only event sequences are known. The utility of the framework is illustrated via an application to dynamic modeling of responder radio communications during the early hours of the World Trade Center disaster.",

    "abstract": "The stochastic actor oriented model (SAOM) is a method for modelling social interactions and social behaviour over time. It can be used to model network effects using both exogenous covariates and endogenous network configurations, but also the co-evolution of behaviour and social interactions. The estimation method mostly used is the Method of Moments (MoM). The model assumption that all individuals have the same evaluation function, however, is one of its limitations. The aim of this paper is to generalize the MoM estimation method for the SAOM to include random effects, so that the heterogeneity of individuals can be modelled more accurately. The linear evaluation function that models the probability of forming or removing a tie from the network, is decomposed in a fixed part, which is the current evaluation function of the SAOM, and a random part, with parameters that are individual-specific and random. The Robbins-Monro algorithm that is commonly used for MoM estimation in the SAOM, is extended to allow the estimation of the variance of the random parameters. We illustrate how for the model with random out-degree we can estimate the parameter of the random components, and how to test its significance. An application is made to Kapferer's Tailor shop dataset. It is shown that including a random out-degree constitutes a serious alternative to including various transitivity effects.",

The networks were analyzed using Pajek—a program for analysis and visualization of large networks. We explore the distributions of some properties of works and the collaborations among mathematicians. We also take a closer look at the characteristics of the field of graph theory as were realized with the publications.",

    "abstract": "Patent Citation Analysis has been gaining considerable traction over the past few decades. In this paper, we collect extensive information on patents and citations and provide a perspective of citation network analysis of patents from a statistical viewpoint. We identify and analyze the most cited patents, the most innovative and the highly cited companies along with the structural properties of the network by providing in-depth descriptive analysis. Furthermore, we employ Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze the citation networks. ERGMs enables understanding the social perspectives of a patent citation network which has not been studied earlier. We demonstrate that social properties such as homophily (the inclination to cite patents from the same country or in the same language) and transitivity (the inclination to cite references’ references) together with the technicalities of the patents (\n              e.g.,\n              language, categories), has a significant effect on citations. We also provide an in-depth analysis of citations for sectors in patents and how it is affected by the size of the same. Overall, our paper delves into European patents with the aim of providing new insights and serves as an account for fitting ERGMs on large networks and analyzing them. ERGMs help us model network mechanisms directly, instead of acting as a proxy for unspecified dependence and relationships among the observations.",

    "abstract": "This study uses recent data to investigate if smoking initiation diffuses through friendship networks over the high school period and explores if diffusion processes differ across schools. One thousand four hundred and twenty-five racially and ethnically diverse youth from four high schools in Los Angeles were surveyed four times over the high school period from 2010 to 2013. Probit regression models and stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics tested for peer effects on smoking initiation. Friend smoking was found to predict adolescent smoking, and smoking initiation diffused through friendship networks in some but not all of the schools. School differences in smoking rates and the popularity of smokers may be linked to differences in the diffusion of smoking through peer networks. We conclude that there are differences in peer effects on smoking initiation across schools that will be important to account for in network-based smoking interventions.",

    "abstract": "Human behavior depends on many factors including the social environment. Over the past decades, scholars have actively developed models that evaluate the impact of the environment on the individual. This article describes stochastic actor-oriented modeling (SAOM) which allows to test hypotheses about the structural evolution of social networks, as well as to analyze the co-evolution of networks and behavior in detail. The authors present theoretical and methodological foundations of SAOM; specify requirements for research design and data collection; consider the specification of the model and an example of co-evolution of the network and academic achievement of students; point out limitations of the method, and suggest promising avenues for further research. The article concludes that using SAOM is preferable for small social networks with low rotation, in particular, for organizational units and study groups. The authors argue that the existing studies mainly consider the educational context and social networks of young people that does not allow to draw conclusions about the evolution of social ties in communities of a different type and other age groups. In addition, most of the research is based on data collected in Western democracies which indicates the need to investigate a variety of samples.",

    "abstract": "Research on co-evolution of networks and behavior became possible with the emergence of student performance and behavior dynamic data collection and storage tools, as well as with the development of new social network analysis methods. Dynamic network analysis answers the question, how specific forms of student behavior, like bad habits, develop and propagate. It is also helpful in following how school or university students enter into friendship or antagonism with each other, as well as in assessing the impact social relations have on academic performance. The paper gives a review of the two key methods used for empirical analysis of social network dynamics. Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOM) represent one of the most elaborated techniques of social network dynamics investigation. This approach regards the present state of a network as dependable on its preceding state uniquely. Network evolution appears to be continuous, not discrete, so that a structural macro change is, in fact, a multitude of micro changes. Instead of dealing with structure of the network and prerequisites for its development, the SAOM model studies the processes underlying any changes recorded. Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (STERGM) are an alternative approach towards research on social network dynamics. In this case, the social network observed is a materialization of one of possible networks with predetermined characteristics. Any network develops in the result of a stochastic process, and the research should be aimed at discovering what forces this process is driven by. Comparison of an empirically discovered network with networks of similar size reveals structural features of the network and characteristics of actors who influenced the process of its establishment. In this paper, we also give an example of how both models can be used with the same set of data.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the collaboration structures and dynamics of the co-authorship network of all Slovenian researchers. Its goal is to identify the key factors driving collaboration and the main differences in collaboration behavior across scientific fields and disciplines. Two approaches to modelling network dynamics are combined in this paper: the small-world model and the mechanism of preferential attachment, also known as the process of cumulative advantage. Stochastic-actor-based modelling of co-authorship network dynamics uses data for the complete longitudinal co-authorship networks for the entire Slovenian scientific community from 1996 to 2010. We confirmed the presence of clustering in all fields and disciplines. Preferential attachment is far more complex than a single global mechanism. There were two clear distinctions regarding collaboration within scientific fields and disciplines. One was that some fields had an internal national saturation inhibiting further collaboration. The second concerned the differential impact of collaboration with scientists from abroad on domestic collaboration. In the natural, technical, medical, and biotechnical sciences, this promotes collaboration within the Slovenian scientific community while in the social sciences and humanities this inhibits internal collaboration.",

Based on the social network analysis method and spatial analysis method, we explore the characteristics of the regional research cooperation network and its spatial pattern, as well as analyze the formation mechanism of the network using the exponential random graph model. The study finds that the scale of the regional innovation network is expanding, the overall network density is gradually increasing, but the nodes are loosely linked, and the regional innovation network is in the stage of deepening development. There is spatial heterogeneity in the regional innovation network, with a dumbbell-shaped distribution of “double-core dominance and central collapse”. During the formation of the regional innovation network, the endogenous structure of the innovation network is multi-connected under the path dependence, and the network development tends to be complicated; the economic strength and scientific research capability of cities and multi-dimensional proximity have a positive influence on the formation of the innovation network, and geographical proximity, social proximity and cognitive proximity can promote intra-regional innovation cooperation.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. We examined the coevolution of adolescent friendships and peer influences with respect to their risk behaviors and social networking site use.\n            Methods. Investigators of the Social Network Study collected longitudinal data during fall 2010 and spring 2011 from 10th-grade students in 5 Southern California high schools (n = 1434). We used meta-analyses of stochastic actor-based models to estimate changes in friendship ties and risk behaviors and the effects of Facebook and MySpace use.\n            Results. Significant shifts in adolescent smoking and drinking occurred despite little change in overall prevalence rates. Students with higher levels of alcohol use were more likely to send and receive friendship nominations and become friends with other drinkers. They were also more likely to increase alcohol use if their friends drank more. Adolescents selected friends with similar Facebook and MySpace use habits. Exposure to friends’ risky online pictures increased smoking behaviors but had no significant effects on alcohol use.\n            Conclusions. Our findings support a greater focus on friendship selection mechanisms in school-based alcohol use interventions. Social media platforms may help identify at-risk adolescent groups and foster positive norms about risk behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic actor-oriented (SAO) models are a family of models for network dynamics that enable researchers to test multiple, often competing explanations for network change and estimate the extent and relative power of various influences on network evolution. SAO models for the co-evolution of network ties and actor behavior, the most comprehensive category of SAO models, examine how networks and actor attributes—their behavior, performance, or attitudes—influence each other over time. While these models have been widely used in the social sciences, and particularly in educational settings, their use in organizational scholarship has been extremely limited. This paper provides a layperson introduction to SAO models for the co-evolution of networks and behavior and the types of research questions they can address. The models and their underpinnings are explained in nonmathematical terms, and theoretical explanations are supported by a concrete, detailed example that includes step-by-step model building and hypothesis testing, alongside an R script.",

Based on the data from the Facebook group, which consists of 7 years of communication from 2011 till 2018, we constructed the networks based on commenting and reacting. The participants activity includes four main periods for stability evaluation of the community. The blockmodeling discloses the structural patterns of interactions in the community. The results show the \"core-periphery\" type of the global structure. The core and periphery are structured differently in the networks of comments and reactions. The stability between the positions in the global structure is high and while the structure may vary in some periods, the size of the core and periphery fluctuates. However, the stability within the positions of the global structure is low, according to the modified Rand index (Cugmas, Ferligoj, 2018).",

    "abstract": "Cooperation helps states realize mutual gains, but mistrust and disagreements over institutional design inhibit cooperation. This article develops a network explanation for how states achieve cooperation in the face of persistent coordination and collaboration problems. The analysis focuses on bilateral cooperation agreements, a vast body of treaties spanning multiple issue areas. Bilateral agreements constitute an evolving network of cooperative ties. This network defines the strategic environment in which states bargain over new agreements, endogenously influencing subsequent bilateral endeavors by revealing strategically valuable information about states’ trustworthiness and preferences over institutional design, while also generating externalities that incentivize bilateral partnerships. Inferential network analysis shows that states are more likely to create bilateral agreements if they (1) share agreements with common third parties, (2) accede to more agreements in general, and/or (3) share important exogenous characteristics with current bilateral partners. These network dynamics drive bilateral cooperation in everything from commodities to cultural exchange to fisheries.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n            \n              This paper examined the relative influence of selection and socialization on alcohol and tobacco use in adolescent peer networks and peer groups. The sample included 1419 Finnish secondary education students (690 males and 729 females, mean age 16 years at the outset) from nine schools. Participants identified three school friends and described their alcohol and tobacco use on two occasions one year apart. Actor‐based models simultaneously examined changes in peer network ties and changes in individual behaviors for all participants within each school. Multi‐level analyses examined changes in individual behaviors for adolescents entering new peer groups and adolescents in stable peer groups, both of which were embedded within the school‐based peer networks. Similar results emerged from both analytic methods:\n              Selection\n              and\n              socialization\n              contributed to similarity of alcohol use, but only\n              selection\n              was a factor in tobacco use.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            Even in diverse schools that provide opportunities for interreligious friendships, Muslim youth disproportionally tend to be friends with Muslims rather than non-Muslims. Echoing broader debates about minorities’ self-segregation versus exclusion by majority group members, a key question is whether religious friendship segregation arises because of Muslims’ in-group bias or because of non-Muslims’ reluctance to befriend them. We suggest that the answer differs for Muslim boys and girls. Building on research on interreligious romantic relations and accounts of the lives of young Muslims and other ethno-religious minorities in Western societies, we propose that religious in-group bias is stronger for Muslim girls than for Muslim boys. Conversely, we expect non-Muslim youth to be more open to befriend Muslim girls than Muslim boys. Applying stochastic actor-oriented models of network dynamics to large-scale longitudinal data of friendship networks in German schools, we find that Muslim girls indeed have a strong in-group bias, whereas non-Muslim youth are not reluctant to be friends with them. Muslim boys, by contrast, have a much weaker in-group bias, but non-Muslim youth are less willing to be friends with them rather than with non-Muslims. A simulation analysis demonstrates that these gendered individual-level processes result in comparable aggregate patterns of friendship segregation among Muslim boys and girls. Religious friendship segregation thus arises because Muslim girls tend to self-segregate and non-Muslim youth are less willing to befriend Muslim boys although the latter are open to interreligious friendships. This gendered friendship-making behavior has implications for the larger question of minority social integration.",

We develop likelihood-based inference for the model and provide computational algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. We illustrate the interpretability of the model in analysing a longitudinal network of friendship ties within a school.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY\n            \n              We consider hierarchical generalized linear models which allow extra error components in the linear predictors of generalized linear models. The distribution of these components is not restricted to be normal; this allows a broader class of models, which includes generalized linear mixed models. We use a generalization of Henderson's joint likelihood, called a hierarchical or\n              h\n              ‐likelihood, for inferences from hierarchical generalized linear models. This avoids the integration that is necessary when marginal likelihood is used. Under appropriate conditions maximizing the\n              h\n              ‐likelihood gives fixed effect estimators that are asymptotically equivalent to those obtained from the use of marginal likelihood; at the same time we obtain the random effect estimates that are asymptotically best unbiased predictors. An adjusted profile\n              h\n              ‐likelihood is shown to give the required generalization of restricted maximum likelihood for the estimation of dispersion components. A scaled deviance test for the goodness of fit, a model selection criterion for choosing between various dispersion models and a graphical method for checking the distributional assumption of random effects are proposed. The ideas of quasi‐likelihood and extended quasi‐likelihood are generalized to the new class. We give examples of the Poisson–gamma, binomial–beta and gamma–inverse gamma hierarchical generalized linear models. A resolution is proposed for the apparent difference between population‐averaged and subject‐specific models. A unified framework is provided for viewing and extending many existing methods.",

Though we do not aim to make a general claim about either being superior to the other across all specifications, we highlight several theoretical differences the analyst might consider and find that with some specifications, the two models behave very similarly, while each model out-predicts the other one the more the specific assumptions of the respective model are met.",

A modified model distance estimator is proposed to help the researcher identify model extensions that will remediate poor fit. A limited simulation study is provided to establish baseline legitimacy for the Mahalanobis distance–based Monte Carlo test and modified model distance estimator. A forward model selection workflow is proposed, and this procedure is demonstrated on a real data set.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the influence of different types of diversity, both observable and unobservable, on the creation of innovative ideas. Our framework draws on theory and research on information processing, social categorization, coordination, and homophily to posit the influence of cognitive, gender, and country diversity on innovation. Our longitudinal model is based on a unique data set of 1,354 researchers who helped create the new scientific field of oncofertility, by collaborating on 469 publications over a 4-year period. We capture the differences among researchers along cognitive, country, and gender dimensions, as well as examine how the resulting diversity or homophily influences the formation of collaborative innovation networks. We find that innovation, operationalized as publishing in a new scientific discipline, benefits from both homophily and diversity. Homophily in country of residence and working with prior collaborators help reduce uncertainty in the interactions associated with innovation, while diversity in knowledge enables the recombinant knowledge required for innovation.",

    "abstract": "Changes in patterns of collaboration between Russian universities after the commencement of the Russian university excellence initiative (Project 5-100) are studied in this paper. While this project aimed to make leading Russian universities more globally competitive and improve their research productivity, it also happened to increase their cooperation. An analysis of affiliations and the co-authorship networks was conducted to explore scientific collaborations between and within the participating universities. Such analysis facilitates the investigation of the number of collaborations with other organizations, both domestic and international cooperation, and disciplinary differences. By analyzing the co-authorship networks, the position of universities in the academic network and the structure of collaborations among the participants were examined. A sample of 30 Russian universities, including participants in Project 5-100 and a control group of institutions with similar characteristics, was used. After joining the project, the participating universities increased both their cooperation with each other as well as with foreign universities and research institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences, especially in the high-quality segment. At the same time, the collaboration patterns of non-participating universities did not change significantly. The centrality of Project 5-100 universities in the global academic network has increased, along with their visibility and coupling in the national network. The historical division between university and academic sectors has diminished, while the participating universities have started to play a more important role in knowledge production within the country.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n            The present study examined whether parenting and parental smoking can prevent children from selecting smoking friends during adolescence. 254 Adolescents of one Belgian secondary school participated. Self‐administered questionnaires were distributed among 2nd–4th graders (mean ages = 14.2–16.2 years) during spring 2006. Follow‐up was conducted 12 months later. Data was analyzed conducting longitudinal social network analyses. Results showed adolescents perceiving high parental psychological control had a significant higher tendency to select smoking friends. Perceived behavioral control and perceived parental support did not affect the selection of smoking friends. Furthermore, maternal smoking behavior affected the selection of smoking friends, although no effect of paternal smoking behavior on the selection of smoking friends was found. Adolescent smoking prevention efforts should focus on the influence of parents through their smoking behavior and their psychological control to decrease adolescents' tendency to select smoking friends resulting in fewer opportunities for negative peer influences to occur.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            Since none of the existing systematic reviews of the literature related to smart cities have focused on smart cities applications using context-aware features, this study aims to provide a comprehensive view of (1) the characteristics of context-aware applications supported by smart cities’ infrastructures, (2) the characteristics of the context-aware technologies being used, and (3) the maturity level of the identified applications. An electronic search was conducted on Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases, combining relevant keywords. After the studies’ selection, 27 studies were included. The results show the interest in using context-aware features to develop smart cities’ applications targeting public health, tourism experience, urban mobility, active citizenship, shopping experience, management of urban infrastructures, public alerts, recommenders, and smart environments. Moreover, the applications reported by the included studies do not allow the execution of actions without the explicit consent of the users, and they integrate personal sensors, sensors deployed in the city and crowdsourcing mechanisms to acquire primary context attributes (i.e., location, activity, and environment) and secondary context attributes (i.e., speed, physical activity, points of interest, stress, and tourists’ emotions). In addition, the included studies present scarce details about context reasoning, data privacy, integrity, and confidentiality, data aggregation and accuracy, and data interoperability. Finally, the results also indicate low maturity level of the developed applications, which is evidenced by the lack of user-centred evaluations, as well as by the difficulty in integrating important technologies being developed for smart cities.",

    "abstract": "For years, organizational communication scholars have been interested in the mechanisms that influence the formation of communication networks. One way to gain a deeper insight into the factors that shape such networks is to model them using exponential random graph modeling (ERGM). However, ERGM has only been applicable to binary networks, reducing communication to something that is either present or not. This article illustrates valued ERGM for organizational communication networks that have a weight associated with each tie. Using a data set on friendship strength between collaborative scientists, results show there are important differences when the network is modeled as binary versus when modeled as valued. In particular, the valued model showed that scientists are more selective regarding friendship (less outdegree activity). Moreover, there were several differences regarding how popular certain disciplines were over others. An online appendix with the R code and data is also included.",

We describe inter-personal conflicts and assess theories of coalition formation in a small-scale human society. Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional social network analysis of men in two communities of Tsimane forager–horticulturalists, we find evidence of reciprocity in coalitional support, as well as evidence of transitivity: an ally of my ally is likely to become my ally. We find mixed support for coalition formation between individuals who share a common adversary. Coalition formation was also predicted by food- and labour-sharing and especially by kinship. Physically formidable men and men higher in informal status were more likely to provide coalitional support over time; evidence was mixed that they receive more coalitional support. The highest status men are hubs of a dense coalitional support network that indirectly link all men in the community. These findings suggest that male coalition formation is multiply motivated, and in general reveals the political dynamics that structure men's lives in small, relatively egalitarian communities.",

We find that different digital technologies may have varying impacts on freedom while affecting its diffusion via different political networks, and that related changes in civil liberties can be affected by both media freedom and internal political institutions. Our analysis suggests three key mechanisms linking information technology with democratic change and highlights the importance of a country's “susceptibility” to political influence that is triggered by greater digitally induced visibility.",

    "abstract": "A class of statistical models is proposed that aims to recover latent settings structures in social networks. Settings may be regarded as clusters of vertices. The measurement model is based on two assumptions. (1) The observed network is generated by hierarchically nested latent transitive structures, expressed by ultrametrics, and (2) the expected tie strength decreases with ultrametric distance. The approach could be described as model-based clustering with an ultrametric space as the underlying metric to capture the dependence in the observations. Bayesian methods as well as maximum-likelihood methods are applied for statistical inference. Both approaches are implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            This paper provides an examination of inter-organizational collaboration in the UK research system. Data are collected on organizational collaboration on projects funded by four key UK research councils: Arts and Humanities Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. The organizational partnerships include both academic and nonacademic institutions. A collaboration network is created for each research council, and an exponential random graph model is applied to inform on the mechanisms underpinning collaborative tie formation on research council-funded projects. We find that in the sciences, collaborative patterns are much more hierarchical and concentrated in a small handful of actors compared to the social sciences and humanities projects. Institutions that are members of the elite Russell Group (a set of 24 high-ranking UK universities) are much more likely to be involved in collaborations across research councils.",

The distributions depend on a function which may be viewed as giving the potential energy of the configurations. Examples include models for interaction in a spatial region and on lattices and graphs. New models in the general class arise naturally, an example being a spatial model for points of different categories. Some general methods, including series expansions and a simulation method known from statistical mechanics, can be useful for many of these models. Several applications of this kind are considered, and some connections between the models and with the statistical mechanics are explored.]",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.",

    "abstract": "We propose a class of actor-oriented statistical models for closed social networks in general, and friendship networks in particular. The models are random utility models developed within a rational choice framework. Based on social psychological and sociological theories about friendship, mathematical functions capturing expected utility of individual actors with respect to friendship are constructed. Expected utility also contains a random (unexplained) component. We assume that, given their restrictions and contact opportunities, individuals evaluate their utility functions and behave such that they maximize the expected amount of utility. The behavior under consideration is the expression of like and dislike (choice of friends). Theoretical mechanisms that are modelled are, e.g., the principle of diminishing returns, the tendency towards reciprocated choices, and the preference for friendship relations with similar others. Constraints imposed on individuals are, e.g., the structure of the existing network, and the distribution of personal characteristics over the respondents. The models are illustrated by means of a data-set collected among university freshmen at 7 points in time during 1994 and 1995.",

    "abstract": "Academic networks are expected to enhance scientific collaboration and thereby increase research outputs. However, little is known about whether and how the initial steps of getting to know other researchers translates into effective collaborations. In this paper, we investigate the evolution and co-evolution of an academic social network and a collaborative research network (using co-authorship as a proxy measure of the latter), and simultaneously examine the effect of individual researcher characteristics (e.g. gender, seniority or workplace) on their evolving relationships. We used longitudinal data from an international network in primary care cancer research: the CanTest Collaborative (CanTest). Surveys were distributed amongst CanTest researchers to map who knows who (the ‘academic social network’). Co-authorship relations were derived from Scopus (the ‘collaborative network’). Stochastic actor-oriented models were employed to investigate the evolution and co-evolution of both networks. Visualizing the development of the CanTest network revealed that researchers within CanTest get to know each other quickly and also start collaborating over time (evolution of the academic social network and collaborative network respectively). Results point to a stable and solid academic social network that is particularly encouraging towards more junior researchers; yet differing for male and female researchers (the effect of individual researcher characteristics). Moreover, although the academic social network and the research collaborations do not grow at the same pace, the benefit of creating academic social relationships to stimulate effective research collaboration is clearly demonstrated (co-evolution of both networks).",

    "abstract": "The democracy-science relationship has traditionally been examined through philosophical conjecture and country case studies. There remains limited global-scale empirical research on the topic. This study explores country-level factors related to the dynamics of the global research collaboration network, focusing on structural associations between democratic governance and the strength of international research collaboration ties. This study combines longitudinal data on 170 countries between 2008 and 2017 from the Varieties of Democracy Institute, World Bank Indicators, Scopus, and Web of Science bibliometric data. Methods include descriptive network analysis, temporal exponential random graph models (TERGM), and valued exponential random graph models (VERGM). The results suggest significant positive effects of democratic governance on the formation and strength of international research collaboration ties and homophily between countries with similar levels of democratic governance. The results also show the importance of exogenous factors, such as GDP, population size, and geographical distance, as well as endogenous network factors, including preferential attachment and transitivity.",

    "abstract": "The development of smart cities is a clear growing trend all around the world. The convergence of different technological, social, political, economical, and ecological trends has allowed the concepts to rise up quickly in governmental agendas. In this paper, we analyze the situation of Russia regarding smart cities. Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Kazan are considered at the “Smart City 3.0” stage of development, meaning that the citizens are participating in their advancement. Our reasons to focus on Russia are two-fold: (1) we know the situation well, as we live and work in a new city, Innopolis, founded in 2015 and meant to be a blueprint for smart cities; (2) large Russian cities are actively developing projects in this sphere and are highly regarded worldwide in these endeavors. It is therefore worth analyzing the context and the trends. By studying the scientific literature and categorizing the features of smart cities the world over, we found that large Russian cities are developing most of the components necessary in order to be called smart. Herein we also discuss areas of possible growth for Russian cities, such as green technologies and a smart environment.",

This article attempts to bring clarity to the situation by adopting an integrated marketing communications perspective. By screening extant metrics for alignment with social media communications objectives, seven key social media metrics are identified. These metrics are then described and their application to social media marketing from an integrated marketing communications perspective is discussed. Finally, limitations of the metrics are considered to arrive at suggestions for future research.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a controlled, prospective trial to evaluate the effectiveness of rapidly infusing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and salt-poor albumin into high-risk, premature infants in the first 2 hours of life. Fifty-three infants, randomized into one of four treatment groups, received 8 ml. per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) NaHCO3, or (D) a combination of albumin and NaHCO3. After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, RDS occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing NaHCO3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Technological advances have resulted in a hyperconnected world, requiring a reassessment of branding research from the perspectives of firms, consumers, and society. Brands are shifting away from single ownership to shared ownership, as heightened access to information and people is allowing more stakeholders to cocreate brand meanings and experiences alongside traditional brand owners and managers. Moreover, hyperconnectivity has allowed existing brands to expand their geographic reach and societal roles, while new types of branded entities (ideas, people, places, and organizational brands) are further stretching the branding space. To help establish a new branding paradigm that accounts for these changes, the authors address the following questions: (1) What are the roles and functions of brands?, (2) How is brand value (co)created?, and (3) How should brands be managed? Throughout the article, the authors also identify future research issues that require scholarly attention, with the aim of aligning branding theory and practice with the realities of a hyperconnected world.",

    "abstract": "Gossip, or sharing information about absent others, has been identified as an effective solution to free rider problems in situations with conflicting interests. Yet, the information transmitted via gossip can be biased, because gossipers may send dishonest information about others for personal gains. Such dishonest gossip makes reputation-based cooperation more difficult to evolve. But when are people likely to share honest or dishonest gossip? We build formal models to provide the theoretical foundation for individuals' gossip strategies, taking into account the gossiper's fitness interdependence with the receiver and the target. Our models across four different games suggest a very simple rule: when there is a perfect match (mismatch) between fitness interdependence and the effect of honest gossip, the gossiper should always be honest (dishonest); however, in the case of a partial match, the gossiper should make a choice based on their fitness interdependence with the receiver and the target and the marginal cost/benefit in terms of pay-off differences caused by possible choices of the receiver and the target in the game. Moreover, gossipers can use this simple rule to make optimal decisions even under noise. We discuss empirical examples that support the predictions of our model and potential extensions.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘The language of cooperation: reputation and honest signalling’.",

    "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels is an important and challenging task for training accurate deep neural networks. Some commonly-used loss functions, such as Cross Entropy (CE), suffer from severe overfitting to noisy labels. Robust loss functions that satisfy the symmetric condition were tailored to remedy this problem, which however encounter the underfitting effect. In this paper, we theoretically prove that \\textbf{any loss can be made robust to noisy labels} by restricting the network output to the set of permutations over a fixed vector. When the fixed vector is one-hot, we only need to constrain the output to be one-hot, which however produces zero gradients almost everywhere and thus makes gradient-based optimization difficult. In this work, we introduce the sparse regularization strategy to approximate the one-hot constraint, which is composed of network output sharpening operation that enforces the output distribution of a network to be sharp and the $\\ell_p$-norm ($p\\le 1$) regularization that promotes the network output to be sparse. This simple approach guarantees the robustness of arbitrary loss functions while not hindering the fitting ability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of commonly-used loss functions in the presence of noisy labels and class imbalance, and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

Here we explore new methods by which BN model development and application are being joined with other tools and model frameworks. Advances include improving areas of Bayesian classifiers and machine-learning algorithms for model structuring and parameterization, and development of time-dynamic models. Increasingly, BN models are being integrated with: management decision networks; structural equation modeling of causal networks; Bayesian neural networks; combined discrete and continuous variables; object-oriented and agent-based models; state-and-transition models; geographic information systems; quantum probability; and other fields. Integrated BNs (IBNs) are becoming useful tools in risk analysis, risk management, and decision science for resource planning and environmental management. In the near future, IBNs may become self-structuring, self-learning systems fed by real-time monitoring data. Such advances may make model validation difficult, and may question model credibility, particularly if based on uncertain sources of knowledge systems and big data.",

This approach combines performance analysis and science mapping for detecting and visualizing conceptual subdomains (particular themes or general thematic areas). It allows us to quantify and visualize the thematic evolution of a given research field. To do this, co-word analysis is used in a longitudinal framework in order to detect the different themes treated by the research field across the given time period. The performance analysis uses different bibliometric measures, including the h-index, with the purpose of measuring the impact of both the detected themes and thematic areas. The presented approach includes a visualization method for showing the thematic evolution of the studied field. Then, as an example, the thematic evolution of the Fuzzy Sets Theory field is analyzed using the two most important journals in the topic: Fuzzy Sets and Systems and IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems.",

    "abstract": "Social network analysis was formed and established in the 1970s as a way of analyzing systems of social relations. In this review the theoretical-methodological standpoint of social network analysis (\"structural analysis\") is introduced and the different forms of social network analysis are presented. Structural analysis argues that social actors and social relations are embedded in social networks, meaning that action and perception of actors as well as the performance of social relations are influenced by the network structure. Since the 1990s structural analysis has integrated concepts such as agency, discourse and symbolic orientation and in this way structural analysis has opened itself. Since then there has been increasing use of qualitative methods in network analysis. They are used to include the perspective of the analyzed actors, to explore networks, and to understand network dynamics. In the reviewed book, edited by Betina HOLLSTEIN and Florian STRAUS, the twenty predominantly empirically orientated contributions demonstrate the possibilities of combining quantitative and qualitative methods in network analyses in different research fields. In this review we examine how the contributions succeed in applying and developing the structural analysis perspective, and the self-positioning of \"qualitative network analysis\" is evaluated.",

In \"The Constitution of Society\" he outlines the distinctive position he has evolved during that period and offers a full statement of a major new perspective in social thought, a synthesis and elaboration of ideas touched on in previous works but described here for the first time in an integrated and comprehensive form. A particular feature is Giddens's concern to connect abstract problems of theory to an interpretation of the nature of empirical method in the social sciences. In presenting his own ideas, Giddens mounts a critical attack on some of the more orthodox sociological views. \"The Constitution of Society\" is an invaluable reference book for all those concerned with the basic issues in contemporary social theory.",

Проведенный систематический обзор литературы позволяет продемонстрировать примеры применения качественного сетевого анализа в эмпирических исследованиях. Выделены четыре способа анализа качественных данных в сетевых смешанных исследованиях: качественный анализ качественных данных, количественный анализ качественных данных, количественный и качественный анализ качественных данных и количественный и качественный анализ качественных и количественных данных. Отмечается отсутствие единого определения методологии качественного сетевого анализа и консенсуса по поводу ее реализации на практике. Выявлены основные возможности качественного сетевого анализа. На уровне объекта исследования качественный сетевой анализ изучает персональные сети отношений индивидов, а также дает возможность доступа к труднодоступным группам респондентов. На уровне предмета исследования качественный сетевой анализ позволяет изучать глубинные смыслы отношений в сети и контексты взаимодействия, описывать и понимать сети изнутри и снаружи, фокусироваться на деятельности акторов и их стратегиях построения сети, а также выявлять темпоральность отношений в сети. Описана позиция, подвергающая сомнению существование качественного сетевого анализа как независимой методологии.",

    "abstract": "Reassembling the Social is a fundamental challenge from one of the world's leading social theorists to how we understand society and the 'social'. Bruno Latour's contention is that the word 'social', as used by Social Scientists, has become laden with assumptions to the point where it has become misnomer. When the adjective is applied to a phenomenon, it is used to indicate a stablilized state of affairs, a bundle of ties that in due course may be used to account for another phenomenon. But Latour also finds the word used as if it described a type of material, in a comparable way to an adjective such as 'wooden' or 'steely'. Rather than simply indicating what is already assembled together, it is now used in a way that makes assumptions about the nature of what is assembled. It has become a word that designates two distinct things: a process of assembling; and a type of material, distinct from others. Latour shows why 'the social' cannot be thought of as a kind of material or domain, and disputes attempts to provide a 'social explanations' of other states of affairs. While these attempts have been productive (and probably necessary) in the past, the very success of the social sciences mean that they are largely no longer so. At the present stage it is no longer possible to inspect the precise constituents entering the social domain. Latour returns to the original meaning of 'the social' to redefine the notion, and allow it to trace connections again. It will then be possible to resume the traditional goal of the social sciences, but using more refined tools. Drawing on his extensive work examining the 'assemblages' of nature, Latour finds it necessary to scrutinize thoroughly the exact content of what is assembled under the umbrella of Society. This approach, a 'sociology of associations', has become known as Actor-Network-Theory, and this book is an essential introduction both for those seeking to understand Actor-Network Theory, or the ideas of one of its most influential proponents.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge confronting contemporary theory is to overcome its fixation on written narratives and the culture of print. In this presentation of a general theory of systems, Germany&#39;s most prominent and controversial social thinker sets out a contribution to sociology that reworks our understanding of meaning and communication.  Luhmann concedes that there is no longer a binding representation of society within society, but refuses to describe this situation as a loss of legitimation or a crisis of representation. Instead, he proposes that we search for new ways of coping with the enforced selectivity that marks any self-description under the conditions of functionally differentiated modern society. For Luhmann, the end of metanarratives does not mean the end of theory, but a challenge to theory, an invitation to open itself to theoretical developments in a number of disciplines that, for quite some time, have been successfully working with cybernetic models that no longer require the fiction of the external observer.  Social Systems provides the foundation for a theory of modern society that would be congruent with this new understanding of the world. One of the most important contributions to social theory of recent decades, it has implications for many disciplines beyond sociology.",

Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications reviews and discusses methods for the analysis of social networks with a focus on applications of these methods to many substantive examples. It is a reference book that can be used by those who want a comprehensive review of network methods, or by researchers who have gathered network data and want to find the most appropriate method by which to analyze it.

Incorporating new contributions from a group of young sociologists and many fascinating and novel case studies, Identity and Control is the only major book of social theory that links social structure with the lived experience of individuals, providing a rich perspective on the kinds of social formations that develop in the process. Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro, Identity and Control presents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.",

Boards arise in firms with large, heterogenous shareholder bases. We propose that an important role of boards is to mediate between  heterogenous shareholders with divergent interests. Voting restrictions are common and ensure that boards are representative and not captured by large blockholders. Boards are given significant powers to both mediate and monitor management, and these roles are intrinsically linked.",

They omit what was a substantial basis of discourse on the company in the first half of the 19th century, namely the notion of trusteeship. The article argues that reintroducing trusteeship addresses many of the current debates around capitalism, explains the bewildering patterns of ownership observed around the world, accounts for the recent failures of capitalism, and is a potential source of enhancing firm performance in the future.",

    "abstract": "Devising and implementing an effective family business succession strategy requires much more than simply estimating the value of the business and buying life insurance to cover any transfer taxes due or to \"equalize\" the estate among all heirs. This approach skips too quickly to identifying and solving the clients liquidity need. Two initial considerations must be addressed before any liquidity need can be accurately identified and effectively solved. First is repackaging: considering whether the business's ownership must be restructured to facilitate a more tax-efficient transfer. Next is redeploying: considering what transfer technique is appropriate (beyond simply relying on undiscounted gifts of voting shares during life or upon death). The purpose of this article is to focus on these first two key considerations broadly, noting along the way how various liquidity need solutions can be properly and effectively integrated. When combined, these constitute an overall strategy of repackaging, redeploying, and leveraging.",

Utilizing a unique data set of over 700,000 private family and nonfamily firms in the U.K. during 2007–2010, we find that family firms are significantly less likely to fail than nonfamily firms. We identify the board characteristics associated with survival/failure in all firms and determine that it is these characteristics that are important in explaining the lower failure probability of family firms. We conclude with an agenda for further research on boards and family firm survival.",

    "abstract": "Family firms often evolve into ownership constellations with multiple family owners. Building on agency theory, we argue that the growing complexity within a group of family blockholders gives rise to what we label family blockholder conflicts, defined as conflicts within a group of family owners. To curb family blockholder conflicts, families often separate the family from its assets and install intermediary governance structures. We explore four frequently applied structures (uncoordinated family, embedded family office, single family office, and family trust), which vary in their degree of separation between family owners and assets and consequently the extent to which the firm might incur family blockholder costs and the double–agency costs associated with appointing agents to oversee agents. We conclude with a discussion of the distributive effects of the four family governance constellations for family wealth over time.",
