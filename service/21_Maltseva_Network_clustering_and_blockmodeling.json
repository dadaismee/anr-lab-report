  {"id":"airoldi2008","abstract":"Observations consisting of measurements on relationships for pairs of objects arise in many settings, such as protein interaction and gene regulatory networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks. Analyzing such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple exchangeability assumptions underlying many boilerplate models no longer hold. In this paper, we describe a class of latent variable models of such data called Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels. This model extends blockmodels for relational data to ones which capture mixed membership latent relational structure, thus providing an object-specific low-dimensional representation. We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We explore applications to social networks and protein interaction networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Airoldi","given":"Edo M"},{"family":"Blei","given":"David"},{"family":"Fienberg","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"airoldi2008","container-title":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"publisher":"Curran Associates, Inc.","source":"Neural Information Processing Systems","title":"Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2008/hash/8613985ec49eb8f757ae6439e879bb2a-Abstract.html","volume":"21"},

The levels are linked by an affiliation relationship, each individual belonging to a unique organization. A new Stochastic Block Model is proposed as a unified probabilistic framework tailored for multilevel networks. This model contains latent blocks accounting for heterogeneity in the patterns of connection within each level and introducing dependencies between the levels. The sought connection patterns are not specified a priori which makes this approach flexible. Variational methods are used for the model inference and an Integrated Classified Likelihood criterion is developed for choosing the number of blocks and also for deciding whether the two levels are dependent or not. A comprehensive simulation study exhibits the benefit of considering this approach, illustrates the robustness of the clustering and highlights the reliability of the criterion used for model selection. This approach is applied on a sociological dataset collected during a television program trade fair, the inter-organizational level being the economic network between companies and the inter-individual level being the informal network between their representatives. It brings a synthetic representation of the two networks unraveling their intertwined structure and confirms the coopetition at stake.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Chabert-Liddell","given":"Saint-Clair"},{"family":"Barbillon","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Donnet","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Lazega","given":"Emmanuel"}],"citation-key":"chabert-liddell2021","container-title":"Computational Statistics & Data Analysis","container-title-short":"Computational Statistics & Data Analysis","DOI":"10.1016/j.csda.2021.107179","ISSN":"0167-9473","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,1]]},"page":"107179","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A stochastic block model approach for the analysis of multilevel networks: An application to the sociology of organizations","title-short":"A stochastic block model approach for the analysis of multilevel networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016794732100013X","volume":"158"},

While methods for blockmodeling networks observed at one time point are well established, it is only recently that researchers have proposed several methods for analysing dynamic networks (i.e., networks observed at multiple time points). The considered approaches are based on k-means or stochastic blockmodeling, with different ways being used to model time dependency among time points. Their novelty means they have yet to be extensively compared and evaluated and the paper therefore aims to compare and evaluate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Different network characteristics are considered, including whether tie formation is random or governed by local network mechanisms.

  {"id":"doreian1996","abstract":"The classic formulation of structural balance by Cartwright and Harary (Psychological Review, 63, 1956, 277‚Äì293) had the basic structural theorem that a balanced structure could be partitioned into two mutually antagonistic subgroups each having internal solidarity. Davis (Human Relations, 20, 1967, 181‚Äì187) extended this theorem for cases where there can be more than two such mutually antagonistic subgroups. We use these theorems to construct a criterion function for a local optimization partitioning procedure for signed digraphs. For any signed digraph, this procedure yields those partitions with the smallest number of errors, a measure of the imbalance in the graph, and an identification of those links inconsistent with both generalized and structural balance. These methods are applied to some artificial data and to the affect data from Sampson (A novitiate in a period of change: An experimental and case study of social relationships, Dissertation, Cornell University, 1968). The latter provides a positive test of a basic tenet of balance theory, that there is a tendency towards balance with signed relations in human groups.

  {"id":"Mali2012","abstract":"Scientific collaboration networks have been studied systematically since 1960 by scholars belonging to various disciplinary backgrounds. As a result, the complex phenomenon of scientific collaboration networks has been investigated within different approaches. Although the term ‚Äúscientific collaboration network‚Äù has different connotations in the literature, we use the term more narrowly to focus on scientific collaboration resulting in co-authored public documents. We broaden this beyond journal articles to include many types of scientific productions in addition to journal articles and books. We insist that these productions are public items available in each field. In this chapter, we focus on the main quantitative approaches dealing with the structure and dynamics of scientific collaboration networks through co-authorized publications. We provide a brief history of social network analysis that serves as a foundation. We further review earlier conceptual classifications of co-authorship networks and distinguish cross-disciplinarily, cross-sectoral and cross-national levels. We couple the newer ideas of ‚Äúsmall world‚Äù models and ‚Äúpreferential attachment‚Äù to older sociological conceptions of scientific collaboration. This is followed by descriptions of deterministic and stochastic models that have been used to study dynamic scientific collaboration networks. We stress the importance of delineating the topology of collaboration networks, understanding micro-level processes and then coupling them. We conclude by outlining the strengths and limitations of various modeling strategies.","author":[{"family":"Mali","given":"Franc"},{"family":"Kronegger","given":"Luka"},{"family":"Doreian","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Ferligoj","given":"Anu≈°ka"}],"citation-key":"Mali2012","container-title":"Models of science dynamics: Encounters between complexity theory and information sciences","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-23068-4_6","editor":[{"family":"Scharnhorst","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"B√∂rner","given":"Katy"},{"family":"Besselaar","given":"Peter","non-dropping-particle":"van den"}],"event-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","ISBN":"978-3-642-23068-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"195‚Äì232","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","title":"Dynamic scientific co-authorship networks","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23068-4_6"},

Our approach, motivated by the importance of controlling for label switching issues across the different time steps, focuses on detecting groups characterized by a stable within-group connectivity behaviour.

While the dynamic interactions can be represented by temporal networks with nodes and links that change over time, they remain highly complex. It is therefore often necessary to use methods that extract the temporal networks‚Äô large-scale dynamic community structure. However, such methods are subject to overfitting or suffer from effects of arbitrary, a priori-imposed timescales, which should instead be extracted from data. Here we simultaneously address both problems and develop a principled data-driven method that determines relevant timescales and identifies patterns of dynamics that take place on networks, as well as shape the networks themselves. We base our method on an arbitrary-order Markov chain model with community structure, and develop a nonparametric Bayesian inference framework that identifies the simplest such model that can explain temporal interaction data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Peixoto","given":"Tiago P."},{"family":"Rosvall","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"peixoto2017","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-017-00148-9","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,19]]},"language":"en","page":"582","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Modelling sequences and temporal networks with dynamic community structures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00148-9","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"stadtfeld2018","abstract":"Important questions in the social sciences are concerned with the link between micro-level behavior and aggregate macro-level outcomes. This article proposes that studies of the micro-macro link in social systems can utilize conceptual representations and analytical strategies from the field of social networks, and that micro-macro dynamics can be investigated by combining state-of-the-art statistical network models with research strategies from agent-based network modeling. An empirical case study illustrates how stochastic actor-oriented models can be applied as empirically calibrated agent-based simulations. The fruitfulness of this approach is demonstrated by a Schelling-inspired case study on the emergence of segregation in social networks. It is shown that even individuals without homophilous preferences may find themselves in segregated structures due to the complex interaction of different network mechanisms. The example thereby illustrates how social networks can serve as a conceptual and analytical framework to study the micro-macro link in dynamic, interdependent, and multi-mechanistic social systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Stadtfeld","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"stadtfeld2018","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,6]]},"language":"en","number":"3211795","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"The Micro-Macro Link in Social Networks","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3211795"},

Block is a part of the network that contain (possible) ties from the units of one cluster to the units of another cluster (or ties within a cluster). Typically, sum of squared deviations from the mean is taken as the measure of variability (non-homogeneity). The paper presents the results of a simulation study that applied several methods for this problem to binary networks generated according to structural equivalence. Several versions of homogeneity generalized blockmodeling (using a relocation algorithm), a k-means-based algorithm, and an indirect approach are compared. Since all of the methods being compared try to optimize the same criterion function, this and the Adjusted Rand Index are the main criteria for the comparison. All methods (except the indirect approach, which is not iterative) were given the same amount of time to find the best possible solution. The overall conclusion is that the k-means approach is advised in most cases, except when smaller networks (200 units) are being partitioned into larger number of clusters, in which case the homogeneity generalized blockmodeling is preferred.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"≈Ωiberna","given":"Ale≈°"}],"citation-key":"ziberna2021","container-title":"Advances in Methodology and Statistics","container-title-short":"Adv Meth Stat","DOI":"10.51936/kcpy2449","ISSN":"1854-0031, 1854-0023","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Comparing different methods for one-mode homogeneity blockmodeling according to structural equivalence on binary networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://mz.mf.uni-lj.si/article/view/212","volume":"18"}
