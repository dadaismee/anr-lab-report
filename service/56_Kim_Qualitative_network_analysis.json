		"abstract": "This article discusses the place of qualitative network analysis in the strategy of mixing methods in the social sciences. We conducted a systematic review of the literature that allowed us to demonstrate examples of the use of qualitative network analysis in empirical research. There are four ways of analyzing qualitative data in network mixed studies: qualitative analysis of qualitative data, quantitative analysis of qualitative data, quantitative and qualitative analysis of qualitative data and quantitative and qualitative analysis of qualitative and quantitative data. Currently, there is a lack of a single definition of the methodology of qualitative network analysis and consensus on its implementation in practice. The main possibilities of qualitative network analysis are discussed in the article. At the level of the research object, qualitative network analysis studies the personal networks of individuals’ relationships, and also make easier an access to hard-to-reach groups of respondents. At the level of the subject of research, qualitative network analysis allows us to study the deep meanings of relationships in the network and the contexts of interaction, to describe and understand networks from the inside and outside, to focus on the activities of actors and their strategies for building a network, as well as to identify the temporality of relationships in the network. The article discusses a position that questions the existence of qualitative network analysis as an independent methodology.",

		"abstract": "Social network analysis was formed and established in the 1970s as a way of analyzing systems of social relations. In this review the theoretical-methodological standpoint of social network analysis ('structural analysis') is introduced and the different forms of social network analysis are presented. Structural analysis argues that social actors and social relations are embedded in social networks, meaning that action and perception of actors as well as the performance of social relations are influenced by the network structure. Since the 1990s structural analysis has integrated concepts such as agency, discourse and symbolic orientation and in this way structural analysis has opened itself. Since then there has been increasing use of qualitative methods in network analysis. They are used to include the perspective of the analyzed actors, to explore networks, and to understand network dynamics. In the reviewed book, edited by Betina HOLLSTEIN and Florian STRAUS, the twenty predominantly empirically orientated contributions demonstrate the possibilities of combining quantitative and qualitative methods in network analyses in different research fields. In this review we examine how the contributions succeed in applying and developing the structural analysis perspective, and the self-positioning of 'qualitative network analysis' is evaluated.",

Despite some limitations discussed in the article, the study illustrates that an applied methodological approach has a potential to overcome some of the pitfalls of ‘structural determinism’ by looking both at structural and contextual aspects as well as actors’ active role in accessing and (re)shaping their business‐related networks across different geographic spaces. The article demonstrates that qualitative social network analysis is particularly valuable for emphasizing the role of human agency and temporal changes of social relations both in terms of network composition and network content as well as for exploring the meaning attached to social ties, potential access barriers to certain types of social capital and strategies to overcome these barriers.",

The volume provides readers with methodological concepts to guide mixed-methods network studies with precise research designs and methods to investigate social networks of various sorts.

Both systems seem to be virtually inevitable and, due to the tacit nature of their workings in class interactions, escape attempts at deliberate control. The article demonstrates how the web of social relationships in the early grades acts to reinforce both systems of social inequality and how they mutually affect one another in the class setting. Two first grade classes were studied for this purpose using mixed methods. The findings clearly support these conclusions: in both classes under study, a configuration of relationships consisting of a range of distinct (student) positions has emerged, and all parties involved have a similar perception of this social configuration. These social positions, each of which offer different opportunities for learning, are reflected both in interactions (as evidenced by video analysis) and the students’ stories (as evidenced in interviews). Such stabilization processes determine student careers early on and render the class setting ‘porous’ as a space of learning.",
