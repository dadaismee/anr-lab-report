This approach skips too quickly to identifying and solving the clients liquidity need. Two initial considerations must be addressed before any liquidity need can be accurately identified and effectively solved. First is repackaging: considering whether the business's ownership must be restructured to facilitate a more tax-efficient transfer. Next is redeploying: considering what transfer technique is appropriate (beyond simply relying on undiscounted gifts of voting shares during life or upon death). The purpose of this article is to focus on these first two key considerations broadly, noting along the way how various liquidity need solutions can be properly and effectively integrated. When combined, these constitute an overall strategy of repackaging, redeploying, and leveraging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"White","given":"William S."},{"family":"Krinke","given":"Timothy D."},{"family":"Geller","given":"David L."}],"citation-key":"white2004","container-title":"Journal of Financial Service Professionals","ISSN":"15371816","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,5]]},"page":"67-86","publisher":"Society of Financial Service Professionals","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"Family Business Succession Planning: Devising an Overall Strategy","title-short":"Family Business Succession Planning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bsu&AN=13048818","volume":"58"},

Building on agency theory, we argue that the growing complexity within a group of family blockholders gives rise to what we label family blockholder conflicts, defined as conflicts within a group of family owners. To curb family blockholder conflicts, families often separate the family from its assets and install intermediary governance structures. We explore four frequently applied structures (uncoordinated family, embedded family office, single family office, and family trust), which vary in their degree of separation between family owners and assets and consequently the extent to which the firm might incur family blockholder costs and the double–agency costs associated with appointing agents to oversee agents.
