  {"id":"vasilevna2016","abstract":"The article analyzes the origin and development of the «economics of happiness», exploring how the subjective well-being depends on the income level. The paper presents various ways to measure of subjective well-being, the laws and relationships identified through an analysis opinion polls, presented the main conclusions obtained by different research teams. The centerpiece of the article covers the analysis of the debate around the Easterlin’s happiness-income paradox. The main purpose of the paper is to designate questions and discussion of current research topics in «economics of happiness», to identify gaps in approaches to research that gave rise to the debate around the happiness-income paradox. The main result is the identification of differences in the approaches to research that lead different groups of scientists to contradictory conclusions about the happiness-income relationship in the long term. The result can be used both in educational process and in research and development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Васильевна","given":"Чинакова Нина"}],"citation-key":"vasilevna2016","container-title":"Мир экономики и управления","event-place":"Россия, Новосибирск","ISSN":"2542-0429","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"number":"1","page":"101-115","publisher":"Федеральное государственное автономное образовательное учреждение высшего образования «Новосибирский национальный исследовательский государственный университет»","publisher-place":"Россия, Новосибирск","source":"cyberleninka.ru","title":"Экономика счастья: современные исследования и дискуссии","title-short":"Экономика счастья","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/ekonomika-schastya-sovremennye-issledovaniya-i-diskussii","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"wuHonestyDishonestyGossip2021","abstract":"Gossip, or sharing information about absent others, has been identified as an effective solution to free rider problems in situations with conflicting interests. Yet, the information transmitted via gossip can be biased, because gossipers may send dishonest information about others for personal gains. Such dishonest gossip makes reputation-based cooperation more difficult to evolve. But when are people likely to share honest or dishonest gossip? We build formal models to provide the theoretical foundation for individuals' gossip strategies, taking into account the gossiper's fitness interdependence with the receiver and the target. Our models across four different games suggest a very simple rule: when there is a perfect match (mismatch) between fitness interdependence and the effect of honest gossip, the gossiper should always be honest (dishonest); however, in the case of a partial match, the gossiper should make a choice based on their fitness interdependence with the receiver and the target and the marginal cost/benefit in terms of pay-off differences caused by possible choices of the receiver and the target in the game. Moreover, gossipers can use this simple rule to make optimal decisions even under noise. We discuss empirical examples that support the predictions of our model and potential extensions.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘The language of cooperation: reputation and honest signalling’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Junhui"},{"family":"Számadó","given":"Szabolcs"},{"family":"Barclay","given":"Pat"},{"family":"Beersma","given":"Bianca"},{"family":"Dores Cruz","given":"Terence D."},{"family":"Iacono","given":"Sergio Lo"},{"family":"Nieper","given":"Annika S."},{"family":"Peters","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Przepiorka","given":"Wojtek"},{"family":"Tiokhin","given":"Leo"},{"family":"Van Lange","given":"Paul A.
