  {"id":"barger","abstract":"Marketers are being inundated with social media metrics, but there is little consensus on what one should be measuring, let alone how these measures inform marketing strategy. This article attempts to bring clarity to the situation by adopting an integrated marketing communications perspective. By screening extant metrics for alignment with social media communications objectives, seven key social media metrics are identified. These metrics are then described and their application to social media marketing from an integrated marketing communications perspective is discussed. Finally, limitations of the metrics are considered to arrive at suggestions for future research.","author":[{"family":"Barger","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Labrecque","given":"Lauren"}],"citation-key":"barger","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"An Integrated Marketing Communications Perspective on Social Media Metrics","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"bland1976","abstract":"We conducted a controlled, prospective trial to evaluate the effectiveness of rapidly infusing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and salt-poor albumin into high-risk, premature infants in the first 2 hours of life. Fifty-three infants, randomized into one of four treatment groups, received 8 ml. per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) NaHCO3, or (D) a combination of albumin and NaHCO3. After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, RDS occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing NaHCO3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.","author":[{"family":"Bland","given":"R.

  {"id":"swaminathan2020","abstract":"Technological advances have resulted in a hyperconnected world, requiring a reassessment of branding research from the perspectives of firms, consumers, and society. Brands are shifting away from single ownership to shared ownership, as heightened access to information and people is allowing more stakeholders to cocreate brand meanings and experiences alongside traditional brand owners and managers. Moreover, hyperconnectivity has allowed existing brands to expand their geographic reach and societal roles, while new types of branded entities (ideas, people, places, and organizational brands) are further stretching the branding space. To help establish a new branding paradigm that accounts for these changes, the authors address the following questions: (1) What are the roles and functions of brands?, (2) How is brand value (co)created?, and (3) How should brands be managed? Throughout the article, the authors also identify future research issues that require scholarly attention, with the aim of aligning branding theory and practice with the realities of a hyperconnected world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Swaminathan","given":"Vanitha"},{"family":"Sorescu","given":"Alina"},{"family":"Steenkamp","given":"Jan-Benedict E.M."},{"family":"O’Guinn","given":"Thomas Clayton Gibson"},{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Bernd"}],"citation-key":"swaminathan2020","container-title":"Journal of Marketing","container-title-short":"Journal of Marketing","DOI":"10.1177/0022242919899905","ISSN":"0022-2429, 1547-7185","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3]]},"language":"en","page":"24-46","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Branding in a Hyperconnected World: Refocusing Theories and Rethinking Boundaries","title-short":"Branding in a Hyperconnected World","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022242919899905","volume":"84"}
