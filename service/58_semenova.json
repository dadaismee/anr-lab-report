  {"id":"al-ballaaUsingExponentialRandom2019","abstract":"Academic collaboration networks can be formed by grouping different faculty members into a single group. Grouping these faculty members together is a complex process that involves searching multiple web pages in order to collect and analyze information, and establishing new connections among prospective collaborators. A recommender system (RS) for academic collaborations can help reduce the time and effort required to establish a new collaboration. Content-based recommendation system make recommendations based on similarity without taking social context into consideration. Hybrid recommender systems can be used to combine similarity and social context. In this paper, we propose a weighting method that can be used to combine two or more social context factors in a recommendation engine that leverages an exponential random graph model (ERGM) based on historical network data. We demonstrate our approach using real data from collaborations with faculty members at the College of Computer and Information Sciences (CCIS) in Saudi Arabia. Our results demonstrate that weighting social context factors helps increase recommendation accuracy for new users.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Al-Ballaa","given":"Hailah"},{"family":"Al-Dossari","given":"Hmood"},{"family":"Chikh","given":"Azeddine"}],"citation-key":"al-ballaaUsingExponentialRandom2019","container-title":"Information","container-title-short":"Information","DOI":"10.3390/info10060220","ISSN":"2078-2489","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,25]]},"language":"en","page":"220","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Using an Exponential Random Graph Model to Recommend Academic Collaborators","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/10/6/220","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"besagStatisticalAnalysisDirty1986","abstract":"[A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly.]","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,13]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Besag","given":"Julian"}],"citation-key":"besagStatisticalAnalysisDirty1986","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

  {"id":"buttsRelationalEventFramework2008","abstract":"Social behavior over short time scales is frequently understood in terms of actions, which can be thought of as discrete events in which one individual emits a behavior directed at one or more other entities in his or her environment (possibly including himself or herself). Here, we introduce a highly flexible framework for modeling actions within social settings, which permits likelihood-based inference for behavioral mechanisms with complex dependence. Examples are given for the parameterization of base activity levels, recency, persistence, preferential attachment, transitive/cyclic interaction, and participation shifts within the relational event framework. Parameter estimation is discussed both for data in which an exact history of events is available, and for data in which only event sequences are known. The utility of the framework is illustrated via an application to dynamic modeling of responder radio communications during the early hours of the World Trade Center disaster.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Butts","given":"Carter T."}],"citation-key":"buttsRelationalEventFramework2008","container-title":"Sociological Methodology","container-title-short":"Sociological Methodology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x","ISSN":"0081-1750, 1467-9531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,8]]},"language":"en","page":"155-200","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Relational Event Framework for Social Action","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"ceoldoStochasticActorOriented2023","abstract":"The stochastic actor oriented model (SAOM) is a method for modelling social interactions and social behaviour over time. It can be used to model network effects using both exogenous covariates and endogenous network configurations, but also the co-evolution of behaviour and social interactions. The estimation method mostly used is the Method of Moments (MoM). The model assumption that all individuals have the same evaluation function, however, is one of its limitations. The aim of this paper is to generalize the MoM estimation method for the SAOM to include random effects, so that the heterogeneity of individuals can be modelled more accurately. The linear evaluation function that models the probability of forming or removing a tie from the network, is decomposed in a fixed part, which is the current evaluation function of the SAOM, and a random part, with parameters that are individual-specific and random. The Robbins-Monro algorithm that is commonly used for MoM estimation in the SAOM, is extended to allow the estimation of the variance of the random parameters. We illustrate how for the model with random out-degree we can estimate the parameter of the random components, and how to test its significance. An application is made to Kapferer's Tailor shop dataset. It is shown that including a random out-degree constitutes a serious alternative to including various transitivity effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ceoldo","given":"Giacomo"},{"family":"Snijders","given":"Tom A.

In this paper, we collect extensive information on patents and citations and provide a perspective of citation network analysis of patents from a statistical viewpoint. We identify and analyze the most cited patents, the most innovative and the highly cited companies along with the structural properties of the network by providing in-depth descriptive analysis. Furthermore, we employ Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze the citation networks. ERGMs enables understanding the social perspectives of a patent citation network which has not been studied earlier. We demonstrate that social properties such as homophily (the inclination to cite patents from the same country or in the same language) and transitivity (the inclination to cite references’ references) together with the technicalities of the patents (\n              e.g.,\n              language, categories), has a significant effect on citations. We also provide an in-depth analysis of citations for sectors in patents and how it is affected by the size of the same. Overall, our paper delves into European patents with the aim of providing new insights and serves as an account for fitting ERGMs on large networks and analyzing them.

Probit regression models and stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics tested for peer effects on smoking initiation. Friend smoking was found to predict adolescent smoking, and smoking initiation diffused through friendship networks in some but not all of the schools.

Over the past decades, scholars have actively developed models that evaluate the impact of the environment on the individual. This article describes stochastic actor-oriented modeling (SAOM) which allows to test hypotheses about the structural evolution of social networks, as well as to analyze the co-evolution of networks and behavior in detail. The authors present theoretical and methodological foundations of SAOM; specify requirements for research design and data collection; consider the specification of the model and an example of co-evolution of the network and academic achievement of students; point out limitations of the method, and suggest promising avenues for further research. The article concludes that using SAOM is preferable for small social networks with low rotation, in particular, for organizational units and study groups. The authors argue that the existing studies mainly consider the educational context and social networks of young people that does not allow to draw conclusions about the evolution of social ties in communities of a different type and other age groups. In addition, most of the research is based on data collected in Western democracies which indicates the need to investigate a variety of samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Докука","given":"София Владимировна"}],"citation-key":"dokukaIspolzovanieStohasticheskihAktornoorientirovannyh2021","container-title":"Мониторинг общественного мнения: экономические и социальные перемены","ISSN":"1815-8617","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"number":"2","page":"273-285","publisher":"Открытое акционерное общество «Всероссийский центр изучения общественного мнения»","publisher-place":"Россия, Москва","source":"cyberleninka.ru","title":"Использование стохастических акторно-ориентированных моделей для анализа коэволюции сетей и поведения","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/ispolzovanie-stohasticheskih-aktorno-orientirovannyh-modeley-dlya-analiza-koevolyutsii-setey-i-povedeniya"},
  {"id":"dokukaStatisticheskieModeliDlya2015","abstract":"Research on co-evolution of networks and behavior became possible with the emergence of student performance and behavior dynamic data collection and storage tools, as well as with the development of new social network analysis methods. Dynamic network analysis answers the question, how specific forms of student behavior, like bad habits, develop and propagate. It is also helpful in following how school or university students enter into friendship or antagonism with each other, as well as in assessing the impact social relations have on academic performance. The paper gives a review of the two key methods used for empirical analysis of social network dynamics. Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOM) represent one of the most elaborated techniques of social network dynamics investigation. This approach regards the present state of a network as dependable on its preceding state uniquely. Network evolution appears to be continuous, not discrete, so that a structural macro change is, in fact, a multitude of micro changes. Instead of dealing with structure of the network and prerequisites for its development, the SAOM model studies the processes underlying any changes recorded. Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (STERGM) are an alternative approach towards research on social network dynamics. In this case, the social network observed is a materialization of one of possible networks with predetermined characteristics. Any network develops in the result of a stochastic process, and the research should be aimed at discovering what forces this process is driven by. Comparison of an empirically discovered network with networks of similar size reveals structural features of the network and characteristics of actors who influenced the process of its establishment. In this paper, we also give an example of how both models can be used with the same set of data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Докука","given":"София Владимировна"},{"family":"Валеева","given":"Диляра Рашитовна"}],"citation-key":"dokukaStatisticheskieModeliDlya2015","container-title":"Вопросы образования","ISSN":"1814-9545","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"number":"1","page":"201-213","publisher":"Федеральное государственное автономное образовательное учреждение высшего образования «Национальный исследовательский университет «Высшая школа экономики»","publisher-place":"Россия, Москва","source":"cyberleninka.ru","title":"Статистические модели для анализа динамики социальных сетей в исследованиях образования","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/statisticheskie-modeli-dlya-analiza-dinamiki-sotsialnyh-setey-v-issledovaniyah-obrazovaniya"},

Its goal is to identify the key factors driving collaboration and the main differences in collaboration behavior across scientific fields and disciplines. Two approaches to modelling network dynamics are combined in this paper: the small-world model and the mechanism of preferential attachment, also known as the process of cumulative advantage. Stochastic-actor-based modelling of co-authorship network dynamics uses data for the complete longitudinal co-authorship networks for the entire Slovenian scientific community from 1996 to 2010. We confirmed the presence of clustering in all fields and disciplines. Preferential attachment is far more complex than a single global mechanism. There were two clear distinctions regarding collaboration within scientific fields and disciplines. One was that some fields had an internal national saturation inhibiting further collaboration. The second concerned the differential impact of collaboration with scientists from abroad on domestic collaboration. In the natural, technical, medical, and biotechnical sciences, this promotes collaboration within the Slovenian scientific community while in the social sciences and humanities this inhibits internal collaboration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferligoj","given":"Anuška"},{"family":"Kronegger","given":"Luka"},{"family":"Mali","given":"Franc"},{"family":"Snijders","given":"Tom A.

The study finds that the scale of the regional innovation network is expanding, the overall network density is gradually increasing, but the nodes are loosely linked, and the regional innovation network is in the stage of deepening development. There is spatial heterogeneity in the regional innovation network, with a dumbbell-shaped distribution of “double-core dominance and central collapse”. During the formation of the regional innovation network, the endogenous structure of the innovation network is multi-connected under the path dependence, and the network development tends to be complicated; the economic strength and scientific research capability of cities and multi-dimensional proximity have a positive influence on the formation of the innovation network, and geographical proximity, social proximity and cognitive proximity can promote intra-regional innovation cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hou","given":"Langong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ye"},{"family":"He","given":"Xiaoqin"}],"citation-key":"houResearchMechanismRegional2023","container-title":"Sustainability","container-title-short":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su15107993","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,13]]},"language":"en","page":"7993","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Research on the Mechanism of Regional Innovation Network in Western China Based on ERGM: A Case Study of Chengdu-Chongqing Shuangcheng Economic Circle","title-short":"Research on the Mechanism of Regional Innovation Network in Western China Based on ERGM","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/10/7993","volume":"15"},

We examined the coevolution of adolescent friendships and peer influences with respect to their risk behaviors and social networking site use.\n            Methods. Investigators of the Social Network Study collected longitudinal data during fall 2010 and spring 2011 from 10th-grade students in 5 Southern California high schools (n = 1434). We used meta-analyses of stochastic actor-based models to estimate changes in friendship ties and risk behaviors and the effects of Facebook and MySpace use.\n            Results. Significant shifts in adolescent smoking and drinking occurred despite little change in overall prevalence rates. Students with higher levels of alcohol use were more likely to send and receive friendship nominations and become friends with other drinkers. They were also more likely to increase alcohol use if their friends drank more. Adolescents selected friends with similar Facebook and MySpace use habits. Exposure to friends’ risky online pictures increased smoking behaviors but had no significant effects on alcohol use.\n            Conclusions. Our findings support a greater focus on friendship selection mechanisms in school-based alcohol use interventions.

This article develops a network explanation for how states achieve cooperation in the face of persistent coordination and collaboration problems. The analysis focuses on bilateral cooperation agreements, a vast body of treaties spanning multiple issue areas. Bilateral agreements constitute an evolving network of cooperative ties. This network defines the strategic environment in which states bargain over new agreements, endogenously influencing subsequent bilateral endeavors by revealing strategically valuable information about states’ trustworthiness and preferences over institutional design, while also generating externalities that incentivize bilateral partnerships.

  {"id":"kretschmerInGroupBiasOutGroup2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            Even in diverse schools that provide opportunities for interreligious friendships, Muslim youth disproportionally tend to be friends with Muslims rather than non-Muslims. Echoing broader debates about minorities’ self-segregation versus exclusion by majority group members, a key question is whether religious friendship segregation arises because of Muslims’ in-group bias or because of non-Muslims’ reluctance to befriend them. We suggest that the answer differs for Muslim boys and girls. Building on research on interreligious romantic relations and accounts of the lives of young Muslims and other ethno-religious minorities in Western societies, we propose that religious in-group bias is stronger for Muslim girls than for Muslim boys. Conversely, we expect non-Muslim youth to be more open to befriend Muslim girls than Muslim boys. Applying stochastic actor-oriented models of network dynamics to large-scale longitudinal data of friendship networks in German schools, we find that Muslim girls indeed have a strong in-group bias, whereas non-Muslim youth are not reluctant to be friends with them. Muslim boys, by contrast, have a much weaker in-group bias, but non-Muslim youth are less willing to be friends with them rather than with non-Muslims. A simulation analysis demonstrates that these gendered individual-level processes result in comparable aggregate patterns of friendship segregation among Muslim boys and girls. Religious friendship segregation thus arises because Muslim girls tend to self-segregate and non-Muslim youth are less willing to befriend Muslim boys although the latter are open to interreligious friendships. This gendered friendship-making behavior has implications for the larger question of minority social integration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kretschmer","given":"David"},{"family":"Leszczensky","given":"Lars"}],"citation-key":"kretschmerInGroupBiasOutGroup2022","container-title":"Social Forces","DOI":"10.1093/sf/soab029","ISSN":"0037-7732, 1534-7605","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1307-1332","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"In-Group Bias or Out-Group Reluctance?

  {"id":"leeHierarchicalGeneralizedLinear1996","abstract":"SUMMARY\n            \n              We consider hierarchical generalized linear models which allow extra error components in the linear predictors of generalized linear models. The distribution of these components is not restricted to be normal; this allows a broader class of models, which includes generalized linear mixed models. We use a generalization of Henderson's joint likelihood, called a hierarchical or\n              h\n              ‐likelihood, for inferences from hierarchical generalized linear models. This avoids the integration that is necessary when marginal likelihood is used. Under appropriate conditions maximizing the\n              h\n              ‐likelihood gives fixed effect estimators that are asymptotically equivalent to those obtained from the use of marginal likelihood; at the same time we obtain the random effect estimates that are asymptotically best unbiased predictors. An adjusted profile\n              h\n              ‐likelihood is shown to give the required generalization of restricted maximum likelihood for the estimation of dispersion components. A scaled deviance test for the goodness of fit, a model selection criterion for choosing between various dispersion models and a graphical method for checking the distributional assumption of random effects are proposed. The ideas of quasi‐likelihood and extended quasi‐likelihood are generalized to the new class. We give examples of the Poisson–gamma, binomial–beta and gamma–inverse gamma hierarchical generalized linear models. A resolution is proposed for the apparent difference between population‐averaged and subject‐specific models. A unified framework is provided for viewing and extending many existing methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Y."},{"family":"Nelder","given":"J.

An electronic search was conducted on Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases, combining relevant keywords. After the studies’ selection, 27 studies were included. The results show the interest in using context-aware features to develop smart cities’ applications targeting public health, tourism experience, urban mobility, active citizenship, shopping experience, management of urban infrastructures, public alerts, recommenders, and smart environments. Moreover, the applications reported by the included studies do not allow the execution of actions without the explicit consent of the users, and they integrate personal sensors, sensors deployed in the city and crowdsourcing mechanisms to acquire primary context attributes (i.e., location, activity, and environment) and secondary context attributes (i.e., speed, physical activity, points of interest, stress, and tourists’ emotions). In addition, the included studies present scarce details about context reasoning, data privacy, integrity, and confidentiality, data aggregation and accuracy, and data interoperability. Finally, the results also indicate low maturity level of the developed applications, which is evidenced by the lack of user-centred evaluations, as well as by the difficulty in integrating important technologies being developed for smart cities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Pacheco Rocha","given":"Nelson"},{"family":"Dias","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Santinha","given":"Gonçalo"},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"Mário"},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Queirós","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Bastardo","given":"Rute"},{"family":"Pavão","given":"João"}],"citation-key":"pachecorochaSystematicLiteratureReview2022","container-title":"SN Applied Sciences","container-title-short":"SN Appl.

  {"id":"pilnyModelingValuedOrganizational2018","abstract":"For years, organizational communication scholars have been interested in the mechanisms that influence the formation of communication networks. One way to gain a deeper insight into the factors that shape such networks is to model them using exponential random graph modeling (ERGM). However, ERGM has only been applicable to binary networks, reducing communication to something that is either present or not. This article illustrates valued ERGM for organizational communication networks that have a weight associated with each tie. Using a data set on friendship strength between collaborative scientists, results show there are important differences when the network is modeled as binary versus when modeled as valued. In particular, the valued model showed that scientists are more selective regarding friendship (less outdegree activity). Moreover, there were several differences regarding how popular certain disciplines were over others. An online appendix with the R code and data is also included.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pilny","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Atouba","given":"Yannick"}],"citation-key":"pilnyModelingValuedOrganizational2018","container-title":"Management Communication Quarterly","container-title-short":"Management Communication Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0893318917737179","ISSN":"0893-3189, 1552-6798","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5]]},"language":"en","page":"250-264","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Modeling Valued Organizational Communication Networks Using Exponential Random Graph Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0893318917737179","volume":"32"},

We describe inter-personal conflicts and assess theories of coalition formation in a small-scale human society. Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional social network analysis of men in two communities of Tsimane forager–horticulturalists, we find evidence of reciprocity in coalitional support, as well as evidence of transitivity: an ally of my ally is likely to become my ally. We find mixed support for coalition formation between individuals who share a common adversary. Coalition formation was also predicted by food- and labour-sharing and especially by kinship. Physically formidable men and men higher in informal status were more likely to provide coalitional support over time; evidence was mixed that they receive more coalitional support. The highest status men are hubs of a dense coalitional support network that indirectly link all men in the community. These findings suggest that male coalition formation is multiply motivated, and in general reveals the political dynamics that structure men's lives in small, relatively egalitarian communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Redhead","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Von Rueden","given":"Christopher R."}],"citation-key":"redheadCoalitionsConflictLongitudinal2021","container-title":"Evolutionary Human Sciences","container-title-short":"Evolut.

The organizational partnerships include both academic and nonacademic institutions. A collaboration network is created for each research council, and an exponential random graph model is applied to inform on the mechanisms underpinning collaborative tie formation on research council-funded projects. We find that in the sciences, collaborative patterns are much more hierarchical and concentrated in a small handful of actors compared to the social sciences and humanities projects.

  {"id":"traagLouvainLeidenGuaranteeing2019","abstract":"Abstract\n            Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Traag","given":"V.

  {"id":"vandebuntFriendshipNetworksTime1999","abstract":"We propose a class of actor-oriented statistical models for closed social networks in general, and friendship networks in particular. The models are random utility models developed within a rational choice framework. Based on social psychological and sociological theories about friendship, mathematical functions capturing expected utility of individual actors with respect to friendship are constructed. Expected utility also contains a random (unexplained) component. We assume that, given their restrictions and contact opportunities, individuals evaluate their utility functions and behave such that they maximize the expected amount of utility. The behavior under consideration is the expression of like and dislike (choice of friends). Theoretical mechanisms that are modelled are, e.g., the principle of diminishing returns, the tendency towards reciprocated choices, and the preference for friendship relations with similar others. Constraints imposed on individuals are, e.g., the structure of the existing network, and the distribution of personal characteristics over the respondents. The models are illustrated by means of a data-set collected among university freshmen at 7 points in time during 1994 and 1995.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Van De Bunt","given":"Gerhard G."},{"family":"Van Duijn","given":"Marijtje A.J."},{"family":"Snijders","given":"Tom A.B."}],"citation-key":"vandebuntFriendshipNetworksTime1999","container-title":"Computational & Mathematical Organization Theory","container-title-short":"Computational &amp; Mathematical Organization Theory","DOI":"10.1023/A:1009683123448","ISSN":"1572-9346","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"167-192","source":"Springer Link","title":"Friendship Networks Through Time: An Actor-Oriented Dynamic Statistical Network Model","title-short":"Friendship Networks Through Time","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009683123448","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"vermondEvolutionCoevolutionPrimary2022","abstract":"Academic networks are expected to enhance scientific collaboration and thereby increase research outputs. However, little is known about whether and how the initial steps of getting to know other researchers translates into effective collaborations. In this paper, we investigate the evolution and co-evolution of an academic social network and a collaborative research network (using co-authorship as a proxy measure of the latter), and simultaneously examine the effect of individual researcher characteristics (e.g. gender, seniority or workplace) on their evolving relationships. We used longitudinal data from an international network in primary care cancer research: the CanTest Collaborative (CanTest). Surveys were distributed amongst CanTest researchers to map who knows who (the ‘academic social network’). Co-authorship relations were derived from Scopus (the ‘collaborative network’). Stochastic actor-oriented models were employed to investigate the evolution and co-evolution of both networks. Visualizing the development of the CanTest network revealed that researchers within CanTest get to know each other quickly and also start collaborating over time (evolution of the academic social network and collaborative network respectively). Results point to a stable and solid academic social network that is particularly encouraging towards more junior researchers; yet differing for male and female researchers (the effect of individual researcher characteristics). Moreover, although the academic social network and the research collaborations do not grow at the same pace, the benefit of creating academic social relationships to stimulate effective research collaboration is clearly demonstrated (co-evolution of both networks).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Vermond","given":"Debbie"},{"family":"De Groot","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Sills","given":"Valerie A."},{"family":"Lyratzopoulos","given":"Georgios"},{"family":"Walter","given":"Fiona M."},{"family":"De Wit","given":"Niek J."},{"family":"Rubin","given":"Greg"}],"citation-key":"vermondEvolutionCoevolutionPrimary2022","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0272255","editor":[{"family":"Vousden","given":"George"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,29]]},"language":"en","page":"e0272255","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The evolution and co-evolution of a primary care cancer research network: From academic social connection to research collaboration","title-short":"The evolution and co-evolution of a primary care cancer research network","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272255","volume":"17"},

In this paper, we analyze the situation of Russia regarding smart cities. Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Kazan are considered at the “Smart City 3.0” stage of development, meaning that the citizens are participating in their advancement. Our reasons to focus on Russia are two-fold: (1) we know the situation well, as we live and work in a new city, Innopolis, founded in 2015 and meant to be a blueprint for smart cities; (2) large Russian cities are actively developing projects in this sphere and are highly regarded worldwide in these endeavors. It is therefore worth analyzing the context and the trends. By studying the scientific literature and categorizing the features of smart cities the world over, we found that large Russian cities are developing most of the components necessary in order to be called smart.
