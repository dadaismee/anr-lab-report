  {"id":"chuan2018","abstract":"Link prediction in online social networks is used to determine new interactions among its members which are likely to occur in the future. Link prediction in the coauthorship network has been regarded as one of the main targets in link prediction researches so far. Researchers have focused on analyzing and proposing solutions to give efficient recommendation for authors who can work together in a science project. In order to give precise prediction of links between two ubiquitous authors in a co-authorship network, it is preferable to design a similarity metric between them and then utilizing it to determine the most possible co-author(s). However, the relevant researches did not regard the integration of paper’s content in the metric itself. This is important when considering the collaboration between scientists since it is possible that authors having same research interests are more likely to have a joint paper than those in different researches. In this paper, we propose a new metric for link prediction in the coauthorship network based on the content similarity named as LDAcosin. Mathematical notions of the link prediction in the co-authorship network and a link prediction algorithm based on topic modeling are proposed. The new metric is experimentally validated on the public bibliographic collection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Chuan","given":"Pham Minh"},{"family":"Son","given":"Le Hoang"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Mumtaz"},{"family":"Khang","given":"Tran Dinh"},{"family":"Huong","given":"Le Thanh"},{"family":"Dey","given":"Nilanjan"}],"citation-key":"chuan2018","container-title":"Applied Intelligence","container-title-short":"Applied Intelligence","DOI":"10.1007/s10489-017-1086-x","event-place":"United States","ISSN":"0924-669X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2470 – 2486","publisher-place":"United States","source":"research.usq.edu.au","title":"Link prediction in co-authorship Networks Based on Hybrid Content Similarity Metric","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10489-017-1086-x","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"coskun2015","abstract":"Link prediction is an important and well-studiedproblem in network analysis, with a broad range of applicationsincluding recommender systems, anomaly detection, and denoising. The general principle in link prediction is to use thetopological characteristics of the nodes in the network to predictedges that might be added to or removed from the network. While early research utilized local network neighborhood tocharacterize the topological relationship between pairs of nodes, recent studies increasingly show that use of global networkinformation improves prediction performance. Meanwhile, in thecontext of disease gene prioritization and functional annotationin computational biology, \"global topological similarity\" basedmethods are shown to be effective and robust to noise andascertainment bias. These methods compute topological profilesthat represent the global view of the network from the perspectiveof each node and compare these topological profiles to assess thetopological similarity between nodes. Here, we show that, in thecontext of link prediction in large networks, the performance ofthese global-view based methods can be adversely affected byhigh dimensionality. Motivated by this observation, we proposetwo dimensionality reduction techniques that exploit the sparsityand modularity of networks that are encountered in practicalapplications. Our experimental results on predicting futurecollaborations based on a comprehensive co-authorship networkshows that dimensionality reduction renders global-view basedlink prediction highly effective, and the resulting algorithmssignificantly outperform state-of-the-art link prediction methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Coskun","given":"Mustafa"},{"family":"Koyutürk","given":"Mehmet"}],"citation-key":"coskun2015","DOI":"10.1109/ICDMW.2015.195","event-title":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW)","ISSN":"2375-9259","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11]]},"page":"485 – 492","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Link Prediction in Large Networks by Comparing the Global View of Nodes in the Network","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7395708/footnotes#footnotes"},

  {"id":"gou2021","abstract":"The data volume of various smart devices has exploded with the advent of the 5G communication era and the rapid development of Internet of Things technology. A large amount of data has higher requirements on the transmission protocol in the network. Most of the existing research focuses on studying a single node as the basic information transmission unit. However, social networks have complex topological structures, and such methods are difficult to grasp the evolutionary rules of the network. It usually leads to higher resource waste and problem complexity. A triad (a network subgraph containing three nodes) can not only provide accurate local topology information, but also its conversion rules are easy to describe, which can reduce the complexity of the problem. The mutual conversion between triads constitutes the evolution of the entire network. Based on this, this article first proposes a triad-based social network evolution analysis method (SNEA). SNEA includes a prediction algorithm (TPMPA) that learns the evolution of the triad transition probability matrix through time series and a quantization algorithm (TTHQA) that quantifies the impact of triad transformations on the network-based on random walks. SNEA integrates the advantages of the two algorithms to dynamically grasp the evolutionary rules of the network. Then this paper proposes a triad link prediction algorithm (TLPA) to quantitatively evaluate the results of the evolution analysis of the SNEA method. The TLPA algorithm reduces the blindness of message forwarding and unnecessary waste of resources by predicting the probability of a connection between nodes in the network. Experimental results show that compared with Epidemic, SECM, CRDNT, ICMT algorithms, our method has a prominent advantage in improving message delivery rate and reducing resource consumption.","author":[{"family":"Gou","given":"Fangfang"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jia"}],"citation-key":"gou2021","container-title-short":"Computer Communications","DOI":"10.1016/j.comcom.2021.10.009","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"143 – 155","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Triad Link Prediction Method Based on the Evolutionary Analysis with IoT in Oportunistic Social Networks","type":"article-journal","volume":"181"},

  {"id":"haupt2021","abstract":"This paper analyzes online user conversation topics and discourse on Twitter related to the “Liberate” Protest movement in reaction to social distancing guidelines at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interdisciplinary approaches in big data, machine learning, content analysis, and social network analysis (SNA) were used to characterize the communicative behavior, conversation themes, and network structures of Liberate protest supporters and non-supporters. Tweets were content coded and grouped within topic clusters produced from an unsupervised machine learning algorithm using natural language processing. An analysis of topic clusters found that tweets that support the protests are highly concentrated and have higher volumes of replicated tweets. Protest Supporters were also more likely to retweet other users while Non-Supporters were more likely to include a URL from an outside media source and produce a unique tweet. SNA was also used to assess the characteristics of retweet networks and found that the Protester Supporter network had a more centralized structure and was strongly influenced by a political organization, in contrast to the Non-Supporter network that had a larger number of smaller and more evenly-sized nodes and more driven by media personalities and commentators. Collectively, these characteristics indicate that protest supporters had more centralized, consistent and disseminated discourse protesting COVID-19 social distancing requirements compared to non-supporters who were more diverse in their criticism of the Liberate movement and generally more fragmented in their support of public health measures. Results from this study provide important insights into pandemic communication dynamics of opposing twitter communities, including in the context of those who oppose and support public health measures in a highly politicized social and online environment. Results are important in the context of assessing the messages, communication propagation and overall activities of social media communities in response to basic public health measures needed to contain this post-digital era global pandemic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Haupt","given":"Michael Robert"},{"family":"Jinich-Diamant","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiawei"},{"family":"Nali","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Mackey","given":"Tim K."}],"citation-key":"haupt2021","container-title":"Online Social Networks and Media","container-title-short":"Online Social Networks and Media","DOI":"10.1016/j.osnem.2020.100114","ISSN":"2468-6964","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,1]]},"page":"100114","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Characterizing Twitter User Topics and Communication Network Dynamics of the “Liberate” Movement During COVID-19 Using Unsupervised Machine Learning and Social Network Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468696420300550","volume":"21"},

One of the most commonly-used and successful recommendation algorithms is collaborative filtering, which explores the correlations within user-item interactions to infer user interests and preferences. However, the recommendation quality of collaborative filtering approaches is greatly limited by the data sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem we have previously proposed graph-based algorithms to explore transitive user-item associations. In this paper, we extend the idea of analyzing user-item interactions as graphs and employ link prediction approaches proposed in the recent network modeling literature for making collaborative filtering recommendations. We have adapted a wide range of linkage measures for making recommendations.

Parallel to this is the need for new methods of reconstructing (inferring) the structure of networks from time-resolved observations of their node-dynamics. The methods based on physical insights often rely on strong assumptions about the properties and dynamics of the scrutinized network. Here, we use the insights from machine learning to design a new method of network reconstruction that essentially makes no such assumptions. Speci cally, we interpret the available trajectories (data) as “features” and use two independent feature ranking approaches—Random Forest and RReliefF—to rank the importance of each node for predicting the value of each other node, which yields the reconstructed adjacency matrix. We show that our method is fairly robust to coupling strength, system size, trajectory length, and noise.

  {"id":"nasiri2022","abstract":"Complex networks are representations of real-world systems that can be better modeled as multiplex networks, where the same nodes develop multi-type connections. One of the important concerns about these networks is link prediction, which has many applications in social networks and recommender systems. In this article, similarity-based methods such as common neighbors (CNs) are the mainstream. However, in the CN method, the contribution of each CN in the likelihood of new connections is equally taken into account. In this work, we propose a new link prediction method namely Weighted Common Neighbors (WCN), which is based on CNs and various types of Centrality measures (including degree, k-core, closeness, betweenness, Eigenvector, and PageRank) to predict the formation of new links in multiplex networks. So, in this model, each CN has a different impact on the node connection likelihood. Moreover, we investigate the impact of interlayer information on improving the performance of link prediction in the target layer. Using Area under the ROC Curve and precision as evaluation metrics, we perform a comprehensive experimental evaluation of our proposed method on seven real multiplex networks. The results validate the improved performance of our proposed method compared with existing methods, and we show that the performance of proposed methods is significantly improved while using interlayer information in multiplex networks.","author":[{"family":"Nasiri","given":"Elahe"},{"family":"Berahmand","given":"Kamal"},{"family":"Samei","given":"Zeynab"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yuefeng"}],"citation-key":"nasiri2022","container-title":"Big Data","container-title-short":"Big Data","DOI":"10.1089/big.2021.0254","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,25]]},"language":"en","page":"138 – 150","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Impact of Centrality Measures on the Common Neighbors in Link Prediction for Multiplex Networks","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"ozcan2016","abstract":"Evolving networks, which are composed of objects and relationships that change over time, are prevalent in many real-world domains and have become an significant research topic in recent years. Most of the previous link prediction studies neglect the evolution of the network over time and mainly focus on the predicting the future links based on a static features of nodes and links. However, real-world networks have complex dynamic structures and non-linear varying topological features, which means that both nodes and links of the networks may appear or disappear. These dynamicity of the networks make link prediction a more challenging task. To overcome these difficulties, link prediction in such networks must model nonlinear temporal evolution of the topological features and link occurrences information of the network structure simultaneously. In this article, we propose a novel link prediction method based on NARX Neural Network for evolving networks. Our model first calculates similarity scores based on quasi-local measures for each pair of nodes in different snapshots of the network and create time series for each pair. Then, NARX network is effectively applied to prediction of the future node similarity scores by using past node similarities and node connectivities. The proposed method is tested on DBLP coauthorship networks. It is shown that combining time information with node similarities and node connectivities improves the link prediction performance to a large extent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Özcan","given":"Alper"},{"family":"Öğüdücü","given":"Şule Gündüz"}],"citation-key":"ozcan2016","DOI":"10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0068","event-title":"2016 15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)","ISBN":"978-1-5090-6167-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"language":"English","page":"381 – 386","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","source":"www.computer.org","title":"Temporal Link Prediction Using Time Series of Quasi-Local Node Similarity Measures","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icmla/2016/07838172/12OmNxbEtMe"},
  {"id":"rettinger2012","abstract":"An important task in network modeling is the prediction of relationships between classes of objects, such as friendship between persons, preferences of users for items, or the influence of genes on diseases. Factorizing approaches have proven effective in the modeling of these types of relations. If only a single binary relation is of interest, matrix factorization is typically applied. For ternary relations, tensor factorization has become popular. A typical application of tensor factorization concerns the temporal development of the relationships between objects. There are applications, where models with n-ary relations with n > 3 need to be considered, which is the topic of this paper. These models permit the inclusion of context information that is relevant for relation prediction. Unfortunately, the straightforward application of higher-order tensor models becomes problematic, due to the sparsity of the data and due to the complexity of the computations. In this paper, we discuss two different approaches that both simplify the higher-order tensors using coupled low-order factorization models. While the first approach, the context-aware recommendation tensor decomposition (CARTD), proposes an efficient optimization criterion and decomposition method, the second approach, the context-aware regularized singular value decomposition (CRSVD), introduces a generative probabilistic model and aims at reducing the dimensionality using independence assumptions in graphical models. In this article, we discuss both approaches and compare their ability to model contextual information. We test both models on a social network setting, where the task is to predict preferences based on existing preference patterns, based on the last item selected and based on attributes describing items and users. The experiments are performed using data from the GetGlue social network and the approach is evaluated on the ranking quality of predicted relations. The results indicate that the CARTD is superior in predicting overall rankings for relations, whereas the CRSVD is superior when one is only interested in predicting the top-ranked relations.","author":[{"family":"Rettinger","given":"Achim"},{"family":"Wermser","given":"Hendrik"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Tresp","given":"Volker"}],"citation-key":"rettinger2012","container-title-short":"Social Network Analysis and Mining","DOI":"10.1007/s13278-012-0069-5","ISSN":"1869-5469","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"373 – 385","title":"Context-Aware Tensor Decomposition for Relation Prediction in Social Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-012-0069-5","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"wang2021","abstract":"Link prediction has aroused extensive attention since it can both discover hidden connections and predict future links in the networks. Many unsupervised link prediction algorithms have been proposed to find these links in a variety of networks. However, there is an evaluation conundrum in unsupervised link prediction. Unobserved links heavily outnumber observed links in large networks, so it is unrealistic to quantify the existence likelihood of all unobserved links to evaluate these algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation paradigm that is sampling unobserved links to address this problem. First, we demonstrate that the proposed paradigm is feasible in theory. Then, we perform extensive evaluation experiments in real-world networks of different contexts and sizes. The results show that the performance of similarity-based link prediction algorithms is highly stable even at a low sampling ratio in large networks, and the evaluation time degradation caused by sampling is striking. Our findings have broad implications for link prediction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jingwei"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yunlong"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Yun"}],"citation-key":"wang2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2002.09165","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,6]]},"number":"arXiv:2002.09165","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Towards Fast Evaluation of Unsupervised Link Prediction by Random Sampling Unobserved Links","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09165"},
